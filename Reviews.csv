0,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
1,5,Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....
2,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much
3,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
4,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."
5,4,"For the peoples who R going to buy R they buyed this Product. U will Face all this Problems 1) Performance of the laptop is so slow 2) Booting time takes 40 sec coz of HDD 3)When u will play Heavy games like Gta 5 of pubg it will lag like A hell 4) Apps opening and closing time is soo slow and Feels like the laptop is lagging and performing Very slow. 5) Whenever u will game on It, The laptop will automatically Get lock and Restart.  Okay Now SolUTion For all of This -  1) Update ur Laptop to..."
6,5,It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå
7,4,Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing aboveüôÑ... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è...there is no problem with the...
8,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment. If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
9,4,Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it 1. The display is good 2. The Laptop runs smoothly 3. Upgradable which is a big pro 4. Great sound quality 5. beautiful build 6. Games work nicely Cons 1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd 2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram  Overall i would really say this is a great laptop
10,5,This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä
11,5,"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale."
12,4,Look perfect üíï Display is nice Sound quality is superb üíï Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance .. 5 day genuine review
13,4,"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.  2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.  Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.  Be sure to download GeForce Experience.  Update all the dr..."
14,1,"Don't ever buy this laptop , the description says it's a gaming laptop but it can't handle games like gta 5 and goes into hibernation mode within 5 minutes of the game and out of the 8gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that slick , hence would advise anyone looking to buy this , avoid it and spend extra and get yourself a better laptop"
15,5,"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners"
16,4,Nice product Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours But performance was very nice 4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price Booting take normal time but its good in hdd Because sdd was fast comparable to hdd I think this is the drawback Company needs to modify ssd on this product
17,5,This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.
18,5,"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa..."
19,5,greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience
20,5,Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.
21,1,"Sorry, after 2 months of buying now....I am thinking why I bought this laptop ....I recommend don't buy you can go with intel instead of ryzen ...I bought it for coding and designing purpose but yet I haven't installed such softwares ...still it is getting hang while watching yt on it ... just like our Android get if memory gets full ...and also some time sentence of some part getting on screen adruptly ....design and display of lappi is excellent but had performence ...."
22,4,Good product performance really awsome and powerful battery life...üòáüòáüòç.. I like it very much
23,4,It is having a wonderful build design ? Build quality is really good Bcoz of not having ssd it's not that fast in opening files apps and softwares It doesn't gets too much heat Overall satisfied with the product
24,5,"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good....."
25,5,It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..
26,5,Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .
27,4,It's small...Design good...Clarity awesome....Performance is good after 1 week use...Battery charges fast and stands nearly 6 hours for normal use ...One minor problem when it's charging we can't use the mouse touch pad smoothly...It's jumping and lagging....Better use separate mouse like i do...Just cause 3 plays very smoothly...Only 6 gb ram we can use as a default... Over all its a good one ...
28,4,"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm. Overall,I would say just to go for it."
29,4,Product is awesome I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..
30,5,"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ..."
31,5,"I am writing these reviews after using 3 months of using this laptop.  Points: 1. RAM capacity is 8GB. If you want to enjoy gaming, atleast install 16GB RAM. 2. I played games like AC Valhalla, GTA 5, RDR 2, Days Gone, Witcher, AC Oddesey, watch dogs 2 and many more. At the highest graphics settings you can sense some lag, but good for mid range graphics. 3.Heating Issue: Yes, this can heat up a lot, but to mention gaming laptops use graphics so that is natural. To use the most out of laptop,..."
32,5,"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ..."
33,3,"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance."
34,5,"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram"
35,4,"I bought this laptop for a balance routine like moderate gaming and normal work, and i have no complaints. The battery backup is really good of around 4hrs 30min to 5 hrs. The keyboard is well lit and you have no problem seeing the buttons even in dark room conditions. Ive been using this for 3 months now and I HAVE NO ISSUES with it. Do keep in mind that this comes with the TRIAL version of Microsoft Office and not the full version. It comes with McAfee antivirus which does a really good j..."
36,5,Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...
37,5,"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get.."
38,5,I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...
39,5,"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB"
40,4,"Ok, so I have a lot to say. First of all, I ordered this laptop for my sister on 7th Nov. My father purchased it and it was fast delivered. Coming to packaging. Flipkart terrible packaging from the outermost. When we first unboxed it the hp package was perfect in condition. The laptop was fresh as anticipated. It was perfectly sealed. Ok now coming to the product. I'll say it directly. Pros Display-15.6 perfect if you want a big screen and got bored of a 14 inch one Processor-a ryzen 5 3550h..."
41,4,This Laptop has a HDD which is really slow at booting...i would recommend you to buy a M.2 NVME SSD for Faster boot time and great performance...and also add up an 8GB ddr4 RAM for great performance
42,4,Nice and best product as per specification but only battery backup is needed and i will suggest tjat if you are buying this product then please insert an SSD for smooth and better experience in it.
43,4,"absolutely satisfied with the product. No ssd in this one but believe me it boots up in freaking 20 seconds. its just mind boggling. performance wise its descent handles my alll the tasks like a charm and it has got a good cooling system as well. fan not so loud so . if u r having a strict budget around 52k just go for this, spending little more and getting a hexa core proccesor model 1021ax would be wiser though. go for it u wont be dissapointed.  Edit: if u buy this one here after do not uo..."
44,4,Overall This Laptop Is Great But Someone Who Want Something Perfect I inform You That For Ame Lovers Its gReat thing as 4gb graphics and 8 gb ram is spectacular on the other hand battery drains quickly when you play games its important to plug in charger while playing  Screen size is small compare to others but its budget friendly so no offense  Need ssd for the fast startup and game lags due to it when power supply is not connected  I lost my battery sign on the taskbar so if anyone know how...
45,4,Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....
46,5,In this price range this is better lappi and you can also option for upgrade your ram and also attached ssd for better performance but one demerit was processor 3350h if HP inbuilt 4600H processor this was AWESOME deal but over all performance was good . Display 5star Battery 5 star Processor 4star But if we attached SSD then speed and performance will increase but overall in this price range i will give 5 star after 20 days use ..
47,4,The product is best at this price ... The only con is it is a little bit slow because of hdd but can be corrected with 256 gb ssd ... So that will not be a big problem... Charging is very fast and battery life in normal usage is 4hours.... Overall good laptop
48,4,"I bought this laptop 7 days back and according to my, this laptop is pretty good .let me first talk about the design, so the design of this product very good and the performance of the battery is also nice but I don't like the keyboard because of the LED light you will not able to see the letters present on the keyboard and the final one is speed. In my case, the laptop speed is a little slow. If you add SSD then it will become more fast. so then thank you for reading my review."
49,5,"Boot time is a little slow but other than that I have know complains. Solid build quality, great screen, good speakers, respectable battery life, bang for the buck gaming performance. Overall very satisfied"
50,3,"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues."
51,5,"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice."
52,5,pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it
53,5,Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance
54,5,Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic
55,5,"Great gaming laptop in affordable price... Must buy for gaming lovers and content creators..   Pros: 1. Display is crisp and smooth 2. Processor 3. Upgradable with SSD upto 1tb and ram upto 32 gb  Cons: 1. Stock HDD is slow and it takes pc to start upto 3-4mins.(once I upgraded with WD SSD and copied the OS from HDD to SSD by WD disk cloning app, this problem cleared and takes me to windows within 10 seconds) 2. Games like GTA V can be played only when the laptop is connected to charger. Wh..."
56,5,Laptop is decent in terms of performance and gaming. Good display and processor for the price. Only con is less ram as integrated vega gfx eats 2gb so u get only 6gb. An additional 8/16gb RAM of 2666mhz speed from crucial can easily solve this problem. Also after 3-4 months the hdd will start acting up. This can be tolerated to some extent but if someone is looking to play games like Valorant or GTA 5 must upgrade to an 512GB SSD. Rest everything is working fine. Its a beautyüî•
57,4,"This is a good laptop.I played farcry 3,farcry 4 without SSD or ram upgrade.But BlueStacks lags.If you are a freefire player you can play lag free in smooth only.Charge don't last long.For gaming 10min it drops more than 20%.With charged only u get smooth fps.If u upgrade ram and SSD it may be good."
58,4,I write this review after using 10 days Design of laptop is excellent Especially display I loved it Battery is disappointing me Except battery all else fine If you are student then go for it Overall this is my first laptop so I love it One more thing performance is bit slow due to hdd If you want to play gt5 then you add ssd this boot your performance
59,4,"This is a decent gaming laptop, not recommended for high end gamers. However for casual gamers it's a nice option and performance is also good."
60,4,"The System is quite good in terms of processing power. The only problem is HDD, it takes ages to load anything. Be it booting or starting any heavy app. It takes a lot of time to run apps and to boot up. The same problem is true for most laptops with HDD as primary storage.  To overcome the long wait in boot time. I use the hibernate option provided by windows instead of shutdown. Hibernate keeps all your apps running and cuts of the power to the system. So the next time you turn it on, it's ..."
61,4,"Display and design are great hdd is slow i updated this ssd its very fast and battery is average but 150watt charges charges very quick, gaming performance while charger plugged is seamless i got it for RS.49240/- perfect deal im happy with it."
62,5,Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.
63,4,"-Laptop looks great. -Display is awesome. -Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day. -Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup. -Speakers are good, but not the best in this price rang e and especially when they mention B & Bo audio system, I expected more from it. -As it has only HDD, it's not that fast, it gets stuck at times but still manageable. -Graphics is good. I played Asphalt 9 legends.  Verdict: Go for it!üëç"
64,4,"Review after 3 months !! If you really want a good display laptop,just go for it. screen display is awesome than asus vivobook and mi notebook. If you want a performance and speed then you really need SSD. without that it is average. Just normal gaming and takes a bit second to open apps and games. Bit SSD will make it a beast !! Overall m happy with the beast üî• no other laptop has such feature in this range. 1. Display 5/5 2. Performance 4/5 (bcoz of hdd) 3. Speaker 4/5 (it's decent) 4. L..."
65,5,It's awesome product.. it's completely fast working process and multi short cut touch and design its ultimate like this laptop . I lived it ... battery backup generally good. Once you completely charged ur working continues online 5hrs I think. As per price the product its better then other laptop.  But design its fibler related plastic. Otherwise the product have supper product I like it product.
66,3,"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage."
67,5,"It is just awesome laptop good design, excellent display,nice graphics It is an awesome product I just loved it"
68,4,"I am satisfied with it at this price.Smooth performance even without ssd , backlight is just awesome I loved it.this is best for overall performance wheather you want to play game ,do editing , everything you can do smoothly.must buy it."
69,5,Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.
70,4,I bought this laptop far a week now.. it was soo cool and amazing performance for this price range.The only issue is with the booting time gets more time because of no ssd.. and the battery is pretty good for my usage..and for great performance there is a M.2 sad slot you can easy add ssd and run os on that ssd it will boot fast and fast processing üî•.. Overall the laptop is beast because of Nividia GTX 1650 graphics üî•üî•..go for it don't hesitate to buy it's a beast for this price range and...
71,5,Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.
72,4,"this laptop needs some extra ram to be installed after purchasing as it is slow in many ways and if possible have some budget after buying it to upgrade it with a ssd and ram then it is a beast. over all build quality is very good. the matte finish make it looks classy but at the same time attracts everything including dust, fingerprints so it needs some pampering. The keyboard backlit is very awesome and is eye catchy , sound is awesome, screen resolution is just best. battery is average jus..."
73,5,One of tha Best laptop for Gaming and also for office work  Pros... Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself.. Then this laptop will be Beast performance.  Cons.... Average webcam Boot time max 30sec... Only 5.9gb Ram available
74,1,"Flipkart and hp, I'm really disappointed in both you with this slow lagging machine. I have seen so many videos that told me that this machine is a very good option but even after spending 55k rupees in this dabba. I'm not even able to use Chrome on it. It's that slow. Yes, not even Chrome. HP people are you sure, you are one of the best companies. You have made this lagging box, just so i can regret trusting you again. I thought maybe 55k is enough for me to get a decent laptop for daily use..."
75,4,Overall I like the laptop and perferably perfer this one.  Pros: 1. Speaker quality is good 2. LED quality is good and great display 3. Keybord is nice 4. Battery back is nice upto 3 hours without games. 5. Laptop build quality is nice. 6. Cooling is very well. 7. Camera quality is quiet well. 8. Processor is at their best  Cons: 1. There should be an SSD in place of HDD ( In this price tag ). 2. There is lagging problem while playing games on battery mode.
76,5,"Ok, first of all this is gaming laptop, so if you are looking for gaming purpose then it's absolutely for you. Now Talking about battery performance then it's as usual like for all gaming laptops. Only thing is it doesn't come with MS office licence key. Overall laptop is worth it...üí• Have a nice day..."
77,4,"Dont judge proformance if u dont know how to setup gaming laptop for gaming 1.update all driver and bios,without this u will face lag and start saying wrost product. 2.setup window mobility or power plan to high proformance and also set best proformance in battery,this will give u constant high proformance for gaming even in battery.but if you are not gaming than set in power sever in battery life otherwise battry drained in 1-2 hours and start crying. 3.Due to radeon vega 8 gpu 2 gb ram wil..."
78,4,Worth it guys go blindly for it but as its a gaming laptop battery backup is not nice but laptop design and other stuff are awesome
79,5,"Go for it , It is a budget friendly laptop with no issues.  You can upgrade in future :- 1)Ram (Upto - 32 GB,3200mhz)The information in product page is wrong. 2)SSD (NVMe)  Backlit keyboard is present at this cost only. The wifi is super fast also the bluetooth. The base speed of processor is 2.10ghz."
80,5,Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.
81,5,"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product."
82,5,Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.
83,4,This is best laptop for students. I really like keyboard and disin. Startup almost 10s. But super and amazing. Perfomance is specialy amazing. I konw ryzen is best than in intel.still i satisfied this product üòç
84,5,"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart."
85,2,"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ..."
86,4,I am writing this review almost a month After I have started using the product. As per the price it is an Ok quality of product. You can expect this quality of product for a range of 50k to 55k. I have got it on 48k inclusive of offers. Pros : 1.Got a very productive and effecient build quality. 2. Backlight Keyboard 3. Great 15.6 Inch Display. 4. Graphics card and Support 5. Rygen 5 Performance is great.  Cons : 1. No Microsoft life usability. It will ask you a license key. 2. Battery lif...
87,1,"Pathetic performance take ages to load the PC, had already replaced it once thought performance will be better in replaced version, it worked for a month now back to the same issue, booting takes a life to load? I also bought extended support with technician visit which does not work they want us to do all sorts of check by us before a technician visit can be arranged so pathetic support system. I won't recommend HP hardware."
88,4,"Its takes a several minutes when its starting for first time. but after that it runs smoothly. Also the specification of RAM given here is 8 gb, yes its true.. but for daily(normal usage) you can use only 6 gb. Rest 2 gb is reserved. The best thing is The display and trackpad.  the thing which I didn't liked is that, it only has 2 usb ports which sometimes feels short when multiple devices needs to be connected.

89,5,Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!
90,5,The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...
91,3,"System starts very slow sometime 12 - 13 minutes. Not happy with that, and if you want to use any good software or number of process then 8GB ( in that only 5.8GB usable its a Big Note to anyone who's is buying laptop because rest of it will be used for video card as per the laptop stands) is not enough.  But don't worry you can buy DDR4 8 GB ram and install so the laptop will be real fast and that might cost another 4.5k.  Overall I don't feel it's good to buy for 51k. Rather I would go for ..."
92,3,"So I waited a LONG time to write this review. I have been using this laptop for about 10 months now and I feel that it is pretty good. It smoothly runs almost every game, and it is great for coding. I use it for literally everything, and it is a great experience. However, using this thing in the first 2 months or so was like the biggest disappointment. It was slow as hell, games did not run properly, and the boot took forever (still takes a bit of time). I contacted HP Support multiple times ..."
93,5,Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram
94,4,I using this laptop from three months. Autocad software are not running smooth. There are lagging problem for heavy autocad work so for autocad or 3 d software this laptop is avarage
95,3,"My initial product had to be replaced because of various issues, I believe I have recieved a product that was returned by someone else.  It was damn slow and plastic felt very cheap, like for example, when you lift the laptop, you hear cracking noise throughout.  2 laptop;  First thing I did to uninstall the trail version antivirus as that made the laptop too slow. Second, updated windows and drivers.  Performance is ok and I'm not rating good because, the load time is very high but once wha..."
96,4,For Gaming Its Performance Is Fab .... But I don't Why it sometimes Lag In Carrying Out Normal Work (that can be due to HDD) Design Looks Unique ü•∞ Speakers are also Good & Overall A Very Good Choice For those... Who have Dreams of Playing Some High Level Games... In Low Budget Laptopsüòäüòä
97,5,If you are go for a decent laptop then I should recommended this as described there is a huge and most of the amount of power that can be delivered by a AMD ryzen 5 3500H processor can be processed and there is a huge lot of processing power and many more decent display decent power backup for 4.5 or and a decent multitasking and full HD display which can be a great pleasure for who can do Photoshop and title gamer why most of us for follow by HDD that can be slow your laptop so you can be go...
98,5,There is 1 slot available u can upgrade ur ram and boost your performance i buyed 8gb hyper ram and boom its amazing u can stay with its 8gab ram no prblm laptop is tooo good
99,5,"It needs upgrade as 2.1 gb of ram is reserved by the GPU itself, so your left with 6 gb of usable ram which bottlenecks gaming, so I upgraded with another 8gb of the same ram make for dual channeling and a samsung 1TB SSD, works smooth which few seconds of boot up and load up of games. Heating is slightly on a higher side, fan loudness is acceptable and battery is ; there's no way to say it but mediocre.  But overall with the updates I have no issues with this laptop, sound quality is good, d..."
100,4,"I am using this laptop for three months. It has only hdd storage, due to that the system was very slow. For boot time it takes almost 3min. Unable to do multitasking. All the operations like copy, paste,file unzipping takes more than 2hours. So within one week I have added sdd storage, since it has the compartment for sdd(cost:3k).Now it's super cool laptop at this price. I can able to do multitasking. I didn't faced any issue after that. If you are ready to spend extra 3k for this laptop you..."
101,5,"If possible buy the SSD version , or add an m.2 nvme ssd on your own (do this only if you know what you are doing). Without SSD its very slow, but yiu can still run a lot of things on it, just that yiu have to wait longer on loading screens. My boot time before ssd was around 1.5 to 2 mins, after I put Crucial P5 m.2 nvme ssd , now my boot time is 12 to 15 seconds. The display and keybord are perfect. Very sturdy design , its designed to last long. Camera is average, but I don't think you are..."

103,3,I m giving a honest review..I m using this laptop for 1 month now..it's not that much fast as I expected..betery quality is good..when I use c++ or Java it's gives a decent experience..but sometimes it takes so much time to start..
104,5,The product is amazing it is must buy from the Flipkart if you want to buy a laptop it is very amazing and it seem as shown their and the functions is also amazing it is superb but the problem is that the battery is getting low in a very short time so this was on the problem otherwise the laptop is amazing
105,5,Nice product and the delivery person was very good and give this item in just 1 day thank you flipcart for fast delivery
106,5,"I have been using this product for both gaming, online classes and movies ...it is awesome in all...not the beast performance but still good as it is budget laptop ....sometimes it freezes for no reason for 1-2 seconds , but my overall review is that my was spent well and it has value of money"
107,3,Battery performance is very awful...only 2 hours battery backup which is very irritating you have to charge it on every 2 hours which might be very disturbing for all of us and the performance is not so great ....apps like even simple apps take 5 min of time to open which is also very irritating and PC needs different types of updates time to time and it take 5 to 10 kin of time to open. Processor is good and graphic card and when you use PC for 4 to 5 hours it heats up like a very hot cooker...
108,5,"After upgrading the ram to 16 gb... All games for this specification works fine. I played few games including pubg pc, warzone, gta v , wolfenstein young blood, gears 5 .. all of them work great in this laptop"
109,5,Excellent product super value for money I mean this is a all rounder though u get gtx 1650 ti in competition but then is jus about 5 % gap go with this upgrade ram and ssd and good to go
110,5,excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.
111,4,"The hp pavilion gaming ryzen 5 laptop is a great option for a mix between business and gaming laptop. It has great design,good sound, great display.good battery and processor. The only downside is it doesn't come with a SSD which is a must for this laptop. It's a little slow without the SSD but since I had the SSD installed it's very fast. All in all a good buy at this price. Add 5k for SSD 500gb"
112,4,Design of the laptop is very good . Performance not that good because some high spec games like GTA 5 are lagging . Need to install a ssd and a 8 GB ram additional. But I think this is the best laptop in this price range as it offers Nvidia gtx 1650 . And also battery backup is also just ok not good .
113,5,I just loved it ....It performed beyond my expectations...If you are planning to get a power laptop with sleek and classy design go for .... It will offer you great experience ...You will just love it..
114,3,I have been using this product for the last 10 days. So let me share my experience here.  -Its packing was great  -It has a decent screen.  -The backlight keyboard with violet color makes it quite attractive.  -speaker sound is good  -Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...
115,2,Startup is very long  Battery is not good  Working speed also no good .  This is the worst experience in laptops I ever used .  I didn't use first 15 days due to some person reasons now till then my return period is over .  Please I strongly recommend don't buy this laptop
116,5,07/09/20 today I got my laptop and it's design is fabulous looking too good. Really lite in weight display is descent for a hdd it is little bit slow but it has a nvme m.2 port for upgrading and a ddr4 extra ram slots so you can upgrade whenever you want to.best laptop for gaming and and work.ryzen processor really works well and that purple colour combinations is really eye catching
117,5,At this prize Intel is giving best laptops. But for 50k ryzen 5 3550h quad core is less At the prize of 45k other laptop is giving ryzen 5 hexa core
118,4,1)i liked it very much because of its design fabulus 2)dispaly was good and bright &veuvienig angles were also good at that price range 3)performace was excelent and it also come with 4gb nvidia gtx 1650 grafix card which can handle the heavy games &softwares easily 4)booting time is little bit late when compare with SSD laptop because it comes only with HDD the good thing is we can easily upgrade the storage with help of SSD up to 1TB 5)we can also upgrade RAM upto 16 gb and it comes with 8...
119,4,"The Product is Good Not Best. There are 2 Problems here, One with Ram and One with HDD. Well Ram issue is not the big issue Here, Games are still Playable. For Those who don't Know out of 8 Gb 2.1 GB of Ram is totally occupied by The Vram of the Cpu, So u are left with 5.88 GB of Ram. Now The game still runs like GTA 5.  But The Issue comes with HDD being 5400 Rpm its less. Its Pc performance degrades. You will see windows starting little late, application taking time to open. Also GTA 5 st..."
120,5,Great laptop especially fans for cooling. Add another 8 gb of ram and an SSD and then it'll skyrocket like no other. Fans do their work exceptionally well as the most important job of a gaming pc is cooling the system. Which is performed best in this price bracket.
121,4,"the laptop is great, an excellent buy for students and gamers alike.  the cpu and gpu work great in gaming and video editing. display size and quality is excellent. the keyboard feels really tactile and good to use. one of the con i found about this laptop is out of the 8gb ram, only 6 gb ram is usable ( 2gb ram is reserved for the integrated graphics). so i reccomend adding another 8gb ram stick for the best performance."
122,4,Ok So first don't trust on my english i hope you people can understand.  I review this laptop after 1 month of use i purchase this laptop on 3rd December 2020 today is 3rd jan 2021.   Look wise product is awesome. looks you want in gaming laptops this laptop satisfy the looks  Lets talk about display and the display is to awesome do not worry about display. Performance wise : you got amd ryzen 5 with radeon vega graphics(for display) and gtx 1650 dedicated graphic card with 8 gigs of ram but...
123,3,At first week the laptop was quite fast it's booting time was also less than 1 min. But after 1 month due to some windows 10 update booting tome went upto 4-5 minutes. And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one. I could suggest you that instead of buying HDD you may buy 4gb 1050 graphic card with SSD. Whi...
124,5,"A great laptop at this price segment with hp branding. I would suggest to go for ssd variant not with hdd one it takes around 15 -20 sec to work properly at time of boot. Battry is decent you can watch videos for 6-7 hrs i guess But dont expect gaming without charging  Conclusion- nice product if you want to do all work gaming , editing, coding and video watching"
125,5,"Wonderful gaming laptop,upgrade the ram to 16gb but it supports until 32gb , ssd then this absolute stunning machine, coding wise this doesnt lag even a little bit. gaming still havent tested yet but the nvidia graphics card 1650 is really awesome , 4k videos run cool"
126,4,"Besides all reviews i fell good after buying this laptop. But their i feel some lag in performance. I prefer you to go for ssd version or buy 256gb or 520 gb ssd for upgrade if you want to enjoy its full performance . Regarding to battery, it is a gaming laptop so thier battery quality is always low as they are build for playing games while charging for full performance.all total battery is better than expected. All total you can go with this laptop but later you have to buy ssd and ram for ..."
127,3,The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...
128,4,"Honestly, this is a good laptop for multitasking and heavy gaming. But it also has some issues which is need to fixed. I highly suggest you to upgrade RAM (16GB) and SSD.  PROS: 1. Can play latest games like Red Dead Redemption at high graphics (30 fps) and GTA 5 which runs as smooth as butter at 60 fps at ultra settings. 2. Suitable for multitasking. 3. Gives high performance and a lag free smooth experience.  CONS: 1. Battery life is bad in this case..."

131,5,"After a month, I'm reviewing this Pros:- 1) The build up of this laptop is literally the best amongst other gaming laptop. Attractive. 2) Better crisp display & also you can do pretty good gaming on this laptop. Like GTA 5 on HDD with 40-50 fps n minor lags. 3) Better Battery backup. Lasts 3.30-4 hrs once charged fully. 4) HP support is appreciable i.e after service 5) Value for money n best at this price.  Cons:- 1) Hard disk rpm is less like 5000 ..."
132,3,Best Value And Discount From Flipkart.... But This Hp pavilion Ryzen 5 Gaming Laptop Not Good For Gaming Performance.... Please add some money and get better Version Of Ryzen And Graphics Cards.... Like GEOFORCE RTX
133,5,PEOPLE LISTEN.... MANY SAY IT'S SLOW AMD WASTE OF MONEY AND CREATE A RUCKUS IN THE BUYER'S MIND.... SEE... IT HAS SLOWER BOOTING TIME ONLY BECAUSE 5400 RPM HDD.... JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS... MAXIMUM 25 SECS BOOT TIME AFTER THIS... MOSTLY 15 TO 18 SECS...... THE LAPPY IS A SEXY BEAST TO BEHOLD....

140,5,Laptop is really pretty first of all. I have played sekiro and mk 11 till now both are working on max. Only issue i am having is of ram the system gets overloaded very easily because of ram. Maybe if we just upgrade it all will be fine. Overall everything is working as expected.
141,4,Review after 2 months usage PERFORMANCE- It's bit slow because of 1TB hard disk..if it was with 512GB SSD then it was perfect beast..add SSD to laptop then it will be excellent..but no problem it's ok BATTERY-Battery is very impressive ...in battery factor it's the best laptop with more time of battery backup...battery best DESIGN-BEASTüíØ SPEAKER-best ever experienceüíØ PRICE- Value for moneyüíØ BEST IN ALL FIELDS JUST FOR SPEED ADD SSD

146,5,A pc like this comes in a lifetime!!!! Very Very happy to purchase this . My dream of gaming came true. Games like The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt and specially Grand Theft Auto V runs beautifully. Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that. Hope upgrading it will fix this issue otherwise everyt...

157,5,I'm in love with this laptop üíúüíúüíú
158,1,Only purchase it if you're ready to spend at least 5-6k more on adding additional RAM and SSD. Without SSD it's dead slow. And you'll need additional RAM to play games as AMD keeps 2.1 gb RAM reserved so you get only 5.8 GB RAM available which is too low.
159,4,"I have reviewed this product after 7 days. First we should update latest version of nvidia gpu and amd Radeon versions and additionally windows updates also. I have played rise of the tomb Raider, you get around 30-40fps on high settings. If I played this game for long hour, laptop automatically locks and hibernate itlsef it is a major issue in this laptop. Additionally u need 8 gb ram to play high end games without laaging, sluttering and smooth. This laptop have hdd capacity boot up time..."
160,5,Very nice product in this price range.
161,1,One of the least efficient thing I have bought from. Flipkart no doubt packaging is quite good But performance of laptop. Is mil. It's boot time is 3-4 times future We have to wait for 2-3 mins for google chrome or microsoft edge to start I think this is not gaming laptop this is waiting laptop all time just we have to. Go on waiting
162,5,Great performance but there is need to add a SSD for boost in the performance.Got the order after a delay than expected delivery date but product wasn't damaged.Product was intact.Overall nice future proof product.
163,5,Beast with beauty
164,5,"This HP laptop is specifically bought for my daughter for her engineering studies as she has to make graphic designs using Solidworks, PTC Creo and Ansys. Ideal computer for Engineering students."
165,5,Guys it's an superlap at this rate but after buying this u need to add SSD card and upgrade the ram nor will will cause u super lag u will hate this so do upgrade the lap I am writing this after use of 7 months I had lag issues before upgrade after upgrated that it's super nice to play games and stream with no lag issues so don't forget to add SSD and Upgrade RAM
166,2,Performing worse than my expectaions. Even my Dell Latitude 3400 works faster and smoother than this.
167,3,1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!
168,5,Must Buy. Excellent product. Value for money.
169,2,"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy."
170,5,Just wow! üòç
171,5,Perfect laptop under 55k
172,1,"Writing this review after 6 month of usage, after updating latest update of nvidia amd and software update boot time it quite okay performance is the worst thing in this laptop games frequently crash and hangs a lot worst experience ever."
173,5,"Best Laptop Ever. I thought the HDD would be slow, but it's booting in 15 seconds. battery backup also fine, I'll Upgrade to SSD and 16 GB ram. it'll be The best ever."
174,5,Let me tell a kutty story .. pay attention Listen to me...this laptop is just awesome naaüòÉ
175,2,Booting is very very slow
176,5,Nice product and nice luking
177,5,Today i have received the laptop..Thanks for flipkart team.. and we will write review the laptop workings after 15 days
178,5,"Don't buy the cheap words of people saying that it is a fraud of something. It is expected for radeon vega 8 to cover up 2 GBs of your ram. I've played cs go, fifa 21,etc and there wasn't much of heating issue. If you are a typical gamer, you should go for a higher laptop. I've got work of programming and modelling, and this product provides satisfaction. You could always a stick of RAM and M.2 nvme SSD for more performance any time you want."
179,5,a personal suggestion extend ram with one more 8 gb stick otherwise gta V lags alot
180,4,Over all Good.... Windows opening speed is low.. may be due to no SSD Thanks fr all trial version software development
181,4,"It's a good laptop you can play games in medium or low settings it can give you around 60 fps,but don't expect High quality gaming with High frame rate,Also if you upgrade the ram and add ssd to it you can increase its performance,the display quality and viewing angles are also good, overall it's a good laptop for its price"
182,4,"This product is good , value for money But after usage of 6 month , laptop will show some problems"
183,1,I have Changed my review from 5 star to one... DUE TO BUILD QUALITY. AFTER using for 2 weeks. The build of this laptop showed its colours. Its very bad. The Hinge is quite rough to open. and it makes a tick noise. Also the ports side plastic quality making tick tick noises when touched. i checked in the service centre. They said the build quality is not promising. but laptop is functional. So poor Feel from this laptop. Look wise its good. no issues. But the feel is totally destroyed coz of...
184,4,Performance is not good but after upgrading ram it's performance boosted after the upgrade the games are played very well.little bit slow but there is a solution upgrade SSD.value for money after upgrading it is the beast.fan noise is loud
185,5,Asowm
186,5,Very good product and less price
187,4,It's a handy laptop for both performance and style. I have been using for a month now and I have zero issues with any of the spec or nuances around the laptop. Ryzen's quad core sure helps keep cpu usage below 50% even during hard core coding moments while I have 20+ tabs open chrome 2-3 heavy developer softwares running simultaneously and Spotify plays music. I have not played games with it so I'm not in a position to talk about the gaming aspects of the laptop.
188,5,Best laptop at this prize range..
189,3,Good product but delay in delivery
190,4,Nice product..
191,4,Nice laptop.
192,5,Gaming experience is absolutely amazing...
193,1,i dont know why but my laptop is very slow i know there is no ssd but this us too much.. it takes time even to open My pc üò≠üò≠
194,4,"Good laptop, but to take full advantage of this you definitely need to upgrade both SSD to make it faster since it is very slow loading applications and even booting and upgrade RAM, coz when I play games on this laptop it stutters a lot since only 5.9gb ram is available. Other than that display, keyboard n track pad are good. I didn't find any worry some heating issues while doing intensive works which is good. Looks premium but it is made full of plastic and one thing I don't like is that p..."
195,5,It's awesome...
196,4,Performance was improved after the updates. Battery is good Edges are sharp and it got me a few times. Not a problem while typing. Display is good Keyboard is single color with two brightness modes and off.
197,5,"Beast üòç 100% I Recommend to buy .Graphics 1650gtx üî•Long Life Battery ...all in one kind this Laptop ..work, travel,gaming suitable ..No heat while play 6hrs Pubg ..you need to careful on edges ..bezel less dat's only problem"
198,5,VERY AWESOME LAPTOP..  BEST LAPTOP IN THIS RANGE  VERY GOOD IN PERFORMANCE
199,4,Preformance + premium looks üíØ Go for it
200,4,The start up time seem to be a bit higher than usual where as the specs should be reducing the time to start. Initially I got a start up time of 20-25 sec to Login Screen .. which was really good. however it seems to be a bit slow now a days. Unsure of the reasons. Battery back is good. Display is beautiful. Very less heating issue. Gaming is good. Haven't done extensive gaming though. In-Built apps helps a lot.
201,1,"The worst investment done by me till date, the product is not at all upto the mark. It is said to be gaming laptop but it has problem of freezing you can't do work as well. Its my worst experience till now in all the laptop i have been used. And if you are going to buy laptop please don't buy ryzen go for another processor."
202,5,"I have used this laptop for a month, the windows that installed on hard disk is very heavy hence booting time is very high, i have reinstalled the deafult windows with bootable pendrive,now its fine for use ,now it take 15 to 20 sec to boot, performance in improved after reinstallation of windows."
203,5,My first laptop purchase and it was the best. Yes off course it is slow but it is nothing that can be solved by an SSD a mere 120gb m.2 nvme can change this laptop a ultimate beast. I play Resident evil 7 and Batman Arkham Knight both perform very well in 1080p Max settings.
204,5,It's all things is good but battery backup is written there 5 hours but it not it's battery backup is is only 3 and half hours
205,3,"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance."
206,5,Awesome laptop
207,5,Just spend 5-7k extra to upgrade RAM and SSD and see your dreams come true
208,3,"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed. Positive points:  Display is value for the money. Design is great, body looks awesome. After effects and GTA V runs like charms.  I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure..."
209,4,"Been 4 months since I got this laptop and must say its been very impressive PROS are the price, the monitor(keep in mind I haven't seen a lot of other IPS monitors), the keyboard, The speakers(amazing) Build quality-made of plastic, but the plastic has a good feel Unique design Actually good selection of ports  CONS The above mentioned plastic is good, but it loves getting smudged and picks up fingerprints  HDD can sometimes be surprisingly slow in game loading 8GbB RAM but obv 2GB of th..."
210,5,Laptop is superb.....ü§ûüî•ü§ô All laptop's give battery backup upto 3-4hrs. That laptop also gives same battery backup. I liked it's thermal cooling system. As the temperature increases the fan spped is increase. Cooling system is superbüî•üî• Design and overall other things are also good.
211,4,Performance is okay. Sound quality is superb. Display is good. The main disappointment is battery. Battery is draining fast
212,5,So far So goood!!!üî•üî•üì£
213,4,It's good.
214,5,Awesome in this price range
215,4,Good üëçüòé
216,3,It was good but sometimes apps like blender and fusion 360 are not responding I don't know exactly what the problem is but I downloaded the apps with lisence but why the are not responding nad battery backup is not up to the mark I think it should be get more backup and charging speed is okay..
217,4,Overall the laptop is good but after using it for 5 days the booting time is very slow but the games run good I would suggest you to go for extra 8gb ram and 250gb ssd.

265,4,It's look is awesome working good but a little slow as it is HDD. Will update about it performance later.  Update- Pros Working fine 1. battery is still good on normal usage gives 7 hours backup and I don't play games on battery will not recommend anyone to do so plug in then play. 2. Hinges and keys are still in amazing state. 3. Thermal give good cooling. 4. Gets fully charged in 1 hour 45 minutes even is you are using it.  Cons 1. Thermal's outlets vent throws half of the hot air directly ...
266,5,SETISFIED IN THIS PRISE :-)
267,1,Worst product ever and i had a worst very bad experience ordering with flipkart the customer care is not helpfull . No one ever listens to the customer
268,4,I got this for 45.5k using card offer best in that price.add SSD 256gb 3.5k and the laptop is beast
269,5,Best laptop in this range with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650
270,5,Working great. No lag. Quality good
271,5,You should go for nvme ssd hardware or u can upgrade this then it would be beast
272,4,Looks great n after use of some time I add my review
273,5,It was fantabulous inthis price range.The display and sound quality of this laptop is top-notch but little bit slow down which is negligible.Good battery backup and backlit keyboard.Iam happy with this.
274,4,Good For the decent Gaming And other user stuff...But cannot run highEnd Games smoothly without The Frame drops...unless You upgrade The Ram.
275,5,Awesome product
276,5,After ssd it is a beast goo for it
277,5,Mind blowing lappy.... I highly recommend just go for it....
278,5,Better to put SSD in it
279,4,"At first it didn't go well,Then I put an SSD, now it's going wellüòä"
280,4,"After 1 week of use my impression:  Perfomence: Laptop is slow compared to others devices at this range, maybe performance will be better after installation of ssd and increasing ram.  Battery: battery backup is descend. I will fully review this after a month or so.  Design: Design is really impressing.  Keyboard & trackpad: keyboard quality is good but trackpad is descend.  I will cover full review after a month or so."
281,1,"Updated review.  Motherboard and battery replaced by HP. Charging is an issue. While using the system, it won't charge. Shutdown and it charges. Bad product  HDD doesn't help. It's slow than slowest. Upgraded with SSD and it became lightning fast. Make the SSD primary drive with OS installation. HDD can be back up one."
282,5,"Good build quality Apart from HDD, everything is great. User can purchase SSD or buy SSD variant for more speed."
283,5,"It's a really great product, I would say go for it and it is also upgradable, so u can buy it if you want a lap for 4-5 years.  Till 1TB SSD can be installed And also extra 8GB ram can be installed (In total 16 GB)."
284,5,I got the 4 days ago this product is value for money buy it this is great deal and at this price this is beast laptop and plus point is Nvidia graphics card 1650 I love this product
285,1,Bought the laptop a week ago and it had already started to hang almost every time I switch it on

292,4,An awesome budget gaming laptop having a good processor but HDD makes its quite slow but all over its Excellent
293,4,"I donnow it takes 2.1 minutes to start only some times, i feel somehere d system is slow, may be bcz of No SSD, but still this shouldn't be this much slow, even opening photos, opening windows takes around 10 seconds some times even 15 seconds, for gaming this is the best....."
294,5,"Best laptop in this range Got at 46k only. Played Valorant without facing any problem Need to add SSD for rough usage, otherwise no problem in normal use with HDD."
295,5,I HAVE A PROBLEM ABOUT THIS LAPTOP NOT ABOUT THIS LAPTOP BUT ABOUT FLIPKART SERVICES FIRSTLY FLIPKART GIVES ME SURITY ABOUT I WILL GOT MY LAPTOP AT 18 OCT AND IT TAKES ONE MORE EXTRA DAY AND IT ARRIVES ON 20 OKAY THATS NOT A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS MY LAPTOP IS ALREDY SETUPED AND WINDOWS IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND ONE USER ACCOUNT IS CREATED ON IT AND SECURITY SOFTWARE IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND FOR CONNECTIVETY THEY ALSO ATTACHED JBL SPEAKER AND MANY MORE AND AND I CHEACKED LAST TIME WHEN ...
296,4,"I got this laptop only in 47,000 .... I am so happy with this product (till now) Battery last long about 5-6 Hr in normal video streaming"
297,2,"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor."
298,1,"Utterly disappointed It literally takes 2.50 min to boot up and another 50 sec for system to set up. Even after read all the comments about its worst performance I made up mind to buy it and hoped I can manage. Now I feel how stupid I was. I am regretting everything now. What I have done to my self!!? It is very slower than my i3 laptop with 2 gb ram. I know SSD WOULD HAVE MADE IT FASTER, BUT REALLY DUDE THIS IS AMD RYZEN 5 WITH 8GB RAM COMMON ON!!!!.what will be more worse than having 8gb ra..."
299,4,Pros: Performance is really good Excellent configuration for the given price  Cons: Poor build quality No pre-installed MS office Battery last long for max of 5hrs unlike hp is claiming like 8hrs
300,3,Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.
301,5,The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product
302,5,Nice to handle
303,1,"Absolutely terrible laptop, gta v lagging even on lowest settings.  Quite possibly the worst purchase and very much a scam. The laptop itself does not have enough RAM to even run MS Paint without lag. Do not buy it under any circumstances."
304,4,This could have ssd card for faster operation and not having disc drive.
305,4,"Only 2 usb slots provided which is disappointing, battery backup is just ok sustainable not that great. Display is ok doesn't have a full HD vibe. Overall a good one."
306,3,Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage
307,4,Laptop is overall value for money and u can play GTA V like games in very high settings. The main problem Im facing is its performance issue.but after installing SSD and Ram this laptop is working very smoothly u won‚Äôt regret after buying it. And finally the Thermals of the laptop @ max temp during GTA V was 84 degree and that is quite good so this laptop is very in thermals also u can play 4-5 hours continuously. üëç
308,4,It an good machine but one must add SSD before or after using it(without SSD it pretty much slow) SSD slot is available(M.2)
309,5,Great quality and good looking device.
310,5,Its amazing laptop with 55k budget..... Awesome experience with gaming..... Battery backup is good..
311,4,Everything is okay but sime times it got slowness as 2 GB RAM out of 8 GB RAM is already locked by system....just getting 20 to 30 seconds hanging
312,5,Best in price but must add SSD
313,5,Must buy product and amazing gaming beast at this price
314,3,Awesome product.
315,5,Nice one but require ssd
316,5,"product is so good just go for it. battery is good. display is awesome. graphics also awesome. it hangs some times , but after the windows update it is awesome. best laptop at this price"
317,3,Not bad
318,5,Perfect device in this price range
319,1,"Don't even think to play warzone with this laptop, it just hangs up and you'll be taking an year to come back to home screen."
320,5,HP IS GREAT FOR LAPTOP AND PRINTER
321,4,Totally good.. U always need charger for avoid lag and battery draining while playing gta 5 and other high games.. Also u need to add ssd. For better perfomence.. 8gb ram. But 5gb available.. Design and backlit is very good... Best value in money..
322,5,Little lagging problem otherwise everything is good üëçüèª
323,5,"Nice laptop in this range.. only one thing that the Laptop Speed is not great as per our expectations, but after update bios and Windows OS Speed increase from than previous speed...."
324,5,Better version but for better performance u need to update ssd
325,4,Everything is good but they are not giving SSD.. Almost all companies are giving SSD in this price..
326,5,"I have used this laptop for more than one month and have not faced a single issue in it..I have played gta 5, did video editing in premiere pro, coding, used Adobe Photoshop and everything was working absolutely fine.. But if you want more smooth exotics l experience you can just upgrade the ram to 16gb and this laptop will become beast.."
327,5,Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.
328,5,"I edited my review after the heavy use like(working on Revit Architecture software).After installing Revit I especially feel it is laggy but if you add SSD then it works fine. Takes time for opening after shut down thats why I keep my pc on sleep mode in day time and shut down only in night. I expected little more in this price range becoz if you invest 55k money in any pc and you will feel disappointed with its functionality,, it is not fair."
329,5,Goodüî•üî•
330,5,It's adorable
331,5,Got it at 43.5k in ugadi sale Good laptop and build quality good
332,4,I had installed the SSD coz hdd is slow overall it's good

335,4,"Can't call this a gaming laptop!! It sucks üò°üò°üò° can't play gta5 properly, it lags, fps drops... worst performance!!Really bad experience!"
336,5,Game will run smoothly if charger is connected üòâ
337,4,"There are only two USB ports.HP should have provided at least four USB ports.Also,cooling ports for the cpu seem to be delicate.Over all a good package.Flipcart packing and delivery top."
338,5,Good packing‚ù§Ô∏è Best customer service‚ù§Ô∏è Budget laptop
339,1,"Never seen a laptop slower than this. Forget gaming, you can't even browse internet on it properly."
340,5,"Best Laptop, I got it for 48897 Good graphic performance feels a bit slower because of AMD Ryzen 5 3550H and no ssd alongwith. display is good battery backup is good sound quality is average It is a light weight laptop around 1.8 kgs looks very stunning"
341,4,Display good Performance is some Butter It is suitable for only students Not for gamers . But keyboard backlight I'm impresse I am Getting windows licence problem
342,1,"It's too much slow my dual core laptop load faster then this, shutdown takes 1.30 minutes and apps lagged too much while opening worst experience till now please don't buy, and main point games are lagging while playing"
343,1,The worst purchase I ever made
344,4,"This is a value for money laptop. I bought it for video editing and boy it does the job so nicely. And I think it's targeted for that exact group, because I think for really high end game it will run short especially with only 6 GB allocated memory. It does take bit long to reboot and you won't find any high performance in normal day to day tasks. But in high end tasks like video editing it comes to life and takes 10% time of what it used to be in my older laptop. I got it at 49k, I think it'..."
345,3,After one year the system becomes very slow. Initial starting take 3 minutes. Opening and closing application too slow. Low performing laptop
346,3,"Please don't buy this product, performance is very bad. Start and shut down is taking too much time.We will go mad."
347,1,Worst laptop ever it started lgaing from day one and can't run basic games very slow and worst performance you expect from a gaming laptop. My money is wasted and now I can't return it. I am stuck with it . Please dont the mistake I did.
348,5,"I was sceptical before buying, but I received a brand new stock, Jan 2021 in February itself. The packing itself was untouched from factory. We bought two, and I asked my daughter about the performance, she gave everything 5 stars and for battery 4 stars. Overall we are happy about the purchase after using it for over a month."
349,4,I am using this laptop for 5 months now. It is incredibly good have also give me 140+FPS during gaming. I mostly plays Valorant and it really runs well. But sometime it performs slow whenever i open up any IDE for coading. I am a CS Student and i like to code a lot but sometimes it lags during debugging and compilation of the code. Maybe its because of SSD. I will edit my Review after I install a ssd in it. Maybe after a month or two.
350,5,Beast Product Tested FALL GUYS - 61-75 FPS ON HIGH SETTINGS MINECRAFT - 50-61 FPS ON FANCY SETTINGS NO LAG GTX 1650 IS BEAST RYZEN 5 3550H IS ALSO GOOD
351,5,Good Laptop for gaming and software coding  Pros Backlight keyboard 6Gb graphic card amd + Nvidia 2 ram slot 1 used and 1 in free Amd Ryzen gaming chip  Cons No ssd so we can add ssd also Only 6 gb ram When installing heavy game cpu get 100% so laptop get hanged
352,4,Performance is good and look is awesome but sometimes the hing is producing sound in turbo mood
353,5,Just awsoom Looks 10/10 Performance best Sound awesome Just love with pavilion
354,5,Product was good and there is no doubt about Flipkart. I am very happy with this product.
355,4,"4 star is only for in this price they can add a 120gb ssd. Because of hdd machine is lagging to much, response time is high. Others all good."
356,4,The only problem is ram. I was only provided with 6gb of ram and there is no option in bios to free the ram. Else every thing is good.
357,5,Expect SSD all features are great
358,4,Nice product allover is good but ssd is important
359,1,Very very slow.worst product from hp.
360,1,This is very bad please don't buy it
361,4,Good performance.
362,1,Flipart People are frauds.
363,4,Super laptop at this price range...must buy no issues yet...
364,5,"This is a, budget gaming laptop"
365,5,Nice laptop
366,3,Best product
367,5,If you add SSD then it becomes beast
368,2,"Not good. After idle time close the laptop does not open and have to forcefully shutdown the laptop . Also, taking more time to start and open."
369,1,Bad hp company Westez money
370,5,Excellent
371,1,Not the value of money
372,4,Nice
373,2,2 months it will work nice after that üôÇ
374,2,The laptop is very slow and it gives only 20-30 fps on gta v 720p resolution
375,4,Best laptop@48465/- i just fall in love with this beast one!!!!!!!
376,4,Good if you extend ram and ssd
377,4,Except battery all features are good.
378,5,With extra 512 gb SSD and 8gb ram this laptop is beast under 50k
379,5,I love it just an amazing ....‚ù§Ô∏èüí´
380,4,Best laptop for gaming after upgrading 16 gb ram Because very lag in gta 5
381,5,Perfect Laptop for gaming! must bye
382,5,"The laptop was super awesome, but just one little problem, there is no screw to install SSD, they must need to provide screws for SSD. I collected one from old laptop, but had to use sandpaper to reduce the screw length. And also added a washer to hold it in place"
383,4,Really Satisfied ‚ò∫Ô∏è
384,4,Add ssd worth 3-5 k and it's beast at this price range Btw adding ssd do not violate the hp warranty
385,5,"Awesome product, amazing speed n performanceü§©üëå"
386,5,Very gud product
387,5,Nice but login slow
388,5,Good working
389,4,"Gaming performance is great but other than gaming, it's slow because it doesn't come equipped with SSD. If you can extend your budget go for SSD variant directly or you can just buy this one and install it later."
390,4,Performance isn't consistent . I think this may be due to processor or the updates for windows 10. Definitely needs SSD minimum 256gb coz the laptop feels incomplete without it . For consistency on performance and reduce the application load time or boot time. The way things are right now it's walking needs SSD to run.
391,5,This laptop can be bought only when you can afford another 10K on SSD and RAM upgrade. Otherwise don't go for it.
392,3,The Laptop is Very Slow(Installed Photoshop & coral) .. Need to add SSD in it...
393,5,Best one
394,4,"Nice performance, almost good"
395,5,U should definitely purchase this laptop as its a budget one... It does hav many features but i got the issue of booting time and slow opening of apps..... After that update it to your latest version and the laptop will work smoothly
396,4,"Everything is good but probably the worst HDD installed. You cannot game even when you get a perfect FPS because it takes time to load and retrieve the data from your hard disk. But for this price, if in case you have installed an SSD which costs around 5k for 500GB M.2 nVme then you can game or do something productive with no issues.  So an extra 5k is required unless you do not want to hard gaming on this.  The plus in this laptop is even when you game a lot with sufficient space and venti..."
397,1,Worst product from HP don't buy this one very very slow
398,3,"Major draw back is booting time takes little bit long ,and sometimes touch pad wouldn't work properly"
399,5,"Used it over an year.. Still running awesome. I am able to play games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Cyberpunk in high quality without any lags. Will recommend to add 8 gb ram more as it has 1 empty ram slot"
400,5,"Writing a review after 1 week usage. I am a surgeon by profession, needed a laptop for presentations, paper writing, some video editing. Design is terrific, gives a classy, techy look...especially the built quality, finish and backlit keyboard. This product is absolutely rocking performance wise... Intially it was lagging a bit then I updated the drivers. It started firing then, It's a complete setup for academic n educational purposes. If more needed I'll upgrade the ram n ssd..."
401,5,Best for 3D work
402,2,Never buy this laptop with hdd it's slow like tortoise
403,5,"Very good laptop. At first it's very slow, but you should add ram and ssd and then it's very fast. I added ram and ssd and now the booting time is around 10 secs. Very good laptop after upgrade."
404,5,Overall good performance
405,1,Forget about gaming.. not even good for normal office use.....Very very very very very slow... Waste of money ..
406,5,Absolutely love this laptop!!!!
407,2,Lap is too slow ... performance is too poor
408,5,Take more time to booting bcz of low rpm than normal HDD Only 5.9GB Ram is usable Sound is Good Good performance
409,4,It's a budget laptop. It has fullfilled all my requirements from playing fifa 20 to coding and installation of appium.
410,5,Bad
411,4,After purchasing the laptop it's speed was slow. Due to high graphics you will get 6 gb ram. And don't even think of playing high quality games without upgrading your laptop. But after 15 days of purchase... I bought a 8 gb ram and 256 gb ssd... After upgrading my laptop became very fast.... So u must spend additional 8k rupees for upgradation !!!
412,1,"very slow, buy ssd or don't buy at all"
413,5,"Value for money... After few setups and updates, it's working very smoothly. Battery backup is also good. Camera is also good . Sound system is quite satisfying."
414,4,Laptop is very good.. looking good.. design good...but it lags sometime...and it is slower than expected üò£üòî..So if You want a beast performance then upgrade it's ram and SSD... Battery is average...and this is my dream laptop..and now I have this dream ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
415,3,"The laptop is so good for doing ur daily works or multitasking and all. The only problem is i can't play games in this it starts to lag and there is a big fps drop. I don't know why it is happening. If anyone could please give me a proper ans, how to repair this problem i would be really greatful."
416,4,"Good laptop, But little bit slow. Looks like using an old gen computer.( I think this is making it slow ""New tech on old hardware type hddüòÖ)So I'll upgrade it lateron . All are saying that will make the performance much faster. I'll update the review afterwards"
417,2,This laptop is vary slow please go for ssd version
418,3,It is good but my delivery boy was very rude
419,5,This product is too good.... Must putchase it.
420,1,"it working very slow , we have to add ssd to working properly, without ssd it is useless"
421,5,Best laptop for College students
422,4,Best laptop for students
423,4,Best laptop in th 50000
424,5,"Superb amazing product, 100% worthy. I bought it for 50000. But remember to buy an ssd. Battery life is up to 3 to 4 hr."
425,5,. So its not a major problem because it has Hdd in it if you install ssd in it will be faster and their will be no lag
426,3,"It takes around 30 seconds to boot, takes time to open any application so overall response time is somewhat more than expected. It doesn't feel today's generation laptop while using."
427,5,Overall laptop is very good but will need add a ssd to it and remember to update your graphic card drivers
428,3,Just need to add sdd and ram then it wll be beast
429,5,"This is the best laptop I've ever bought in my life till now. The only lack I feel is that they didn't provide MS office full version for permanent. They've a trial version of very short duration. Now even needs to buy the software separately, I feel the extra expense."
430,3,IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...
431,1,Very poor performance... takes almost an hour to start That too after restarting after 4-5 times Very slow  Worst laptop ever experienced
432,5,"After one month of Laptop , i felt it is value for money. Only one trouble is that booting time is little longer. If we add a PCIe NVMe card this problem should get resolved"
433,5,"Best in its class. Ram & SSD upgrade is a must other than that no issues, battery üîã is fine ."
434,4,When system is starting than it will much slow open and its performance is also slow otherwise it was best its better also good
435,5,Best laptop at this Price range
436,5,Best at this price
437,5,Simply superb !!
438,5,This is a worth product at this price..... Such a nice performance it has
439,5,"After using 3months I'm posting my review.... simply it's awsm.... If u r looking laptop for design, coding, gaming etc.... go for it..."
440,4,Need to upgrade SSD for smooth but performance with hdd is good for low end users
441,4,Great product . But if possible get yourself a SSD and 8gigs of extra RAM then you will enjoy it at its full capacity. HDD is too slow. And other than that it felt value for money.
442,5,All features are very good ..but battery backup only problem ..less time working
443,5,Good
444,5,Just wow
445,5,In price approx 50000 the product is very good and performance is also good.

486,1,"Delivery is much delay ... Buy only for coding and other responses , not for gaming.. I recommend to upgrade ssd for gaming.."
487,5,Added a SSD and now I can't expect a better computer at this price.  You can run it without a SSD as well. But adding one is highly recommended. You get a whole different experience. Totally happy.
488,4,Nice product
489,5,I am very glad to buy this laptop . It is my best laptop till now I buy all of them.
490,4,Nice laptop great......üëå

492,5,Worth for money
493,5,Value for money.and also good product
494,4,"The overall performance is so good,"
495,5,Very good laptop but little slow...design is just amazing..
496,2,Too slow nd charge drain out very soon not worth it!!
497,4,Better to use ssd for fast speed
498,5,Value For Money best laptop ü§©
499,3,Lil bit slow.. Rest everything all right. Moreover the product looks premium w.r.t price segment..
500,3,"I recently purchased this laptop and getting very good performance but having heating issue on right side of keyboard panel and left side of heating vents downside which is more than usual. This thing bothers me that you touching your laptop and feel heat. Otherwise all other things are good.  Heating isn't a small issue which you can ignore. It troubles you everytime you use your device. I've no option to return, only replacement is acceptable which worth nothing to me because I think the wh..."
501,5,"Genuine product, trust worthy."
502,4,Overall happy
503,5,Good product.....you can go for it
504,5,It is best laptop for gaming
505,5,Every thing is fine but slightly slow due to without ssd and extra ram
506,4,"After 1 week of usage. Should have gone for SSD is the only drawback. There's another slot for expansion, which is a good option. No lag issues and maximum boot time is between 2 - 3 seconds which is good for HDD these days. Ryzen 5 is just out of the box. Battery life is also good. We can manually enable 4K with AMD settings on the system."
507,3,Not for value for money
508,2,I think it is refreshing
509,2,"Sent a defective laptop after placing an order it took just 4 days to deliver the product but when I applied for returns its been 8 days still the product is with me, the procedure to return anything is pathetic product is good only need to install an ssd for better percormance"
510,5,"Great Machine, Got it for 52k on sale and it is worth every penny, played Doom, Doom Eternal, GTA V, Just Cause and other great titles without even a single lag. go for it without a second thought :)"
511,5,Excellent Performance with this affordable price
512,4,U have to add SSD for better performance. When i switched it on performance was not good as i expected. Bought 250 GB Kingston additional SSD. Now it's good.
513,1,Extremely Slow and poor performance! The specifications look impressive only on paper but the falsely hyped Laptop is extremely disappointing. It takes over 4 minutes to boot and several seconds to open applications. The battery life is around 1.5 hours so you have to rely on constant power to continue working. HP support is not impressive because the customer service team isn't technically qualified to resolve common issues. Would strongly advise against buying HP laptops.
514,5,Fantasticüòç
515,4,It's nice product
516,5,Please provide atleast 128 gb SSD for fast boot .One of the best laptop and gorgeous look.
517,4,Good but little bit slow if you used ssd than it will be okay
518,3,taking too much time to start
519,4,It is good product..

525,3,"After Using This Lappy , Geniune Review  It's working Slow due to Hdd Speed Is 5000Rpm  You Need to Upgrade RAM & NVME SSD"
526,5,Superb
527,5,Great product.
528,5,"Ok , nice Product under 50k range , but please increase your packing quality , this type of packing is not suitable for 50k item"
529,4,It is very good at performance and also best for gaming at this price If you want to buy dont think just go for it.
530,3,Performance not so good without ssd so i prefer to say must buy ssd for it.
531,5,Beauty and Beast üòç Will upgrade RAM Will install 512 GB SSD Worth every penny in this price range ‚úåüèª
532,4,"Slow like hell due to lack of SSD... otherwise it is best in this price range... go for it guys After adding a NVME M.2 SSD, I got better performance"
533,5,This is a good and best laptop
534,5,Nice product from hp. Value for money .
535,5,Best laptop under 60000
536,4,It's ok
537,4,"Build is perfect ,display is good ,battery performance is normal ,speed is value for money üí∞"
538,5,Good
539,5,Good for gaming and Web designing but it takes little more time to start and shutdown
540,5,One of the best laptop in this price segment(around 52k). Display is awesome. Just install any 256/512GB nvme SSD and it's performance would change drastically! Overall AMD Ryzen 5 3550H is a good processor for casual gamers.
541,3,Poor quality of Flipkart packing
542,3,U need to upgrade it by adding more ram and adding and ssd without this lags a lot very slow pc
543,5,Everything is good..
544,5,Perfomace is good only bootup takes time due to hdd bit games run flawless
545,5,Good
546,5,Amazing product just lv it.....performance is awsome... What a display... Lovely....
547,4,good. but noticed lags in it .
548,4,you can purchase it without any hesitation
549,4,Use SSD for even more better performance
550,5,best gaming laptop
551,5,You definitely need a SSD card if you buy this laptop. It has 2.1GHZ processor. If you buy this laptop for gaming than go for 3.1GHZ processor in this category or install a SSD card. Otherwise it will work Slow. Just that processor is slow otherwise it's good laptop to buy.
552,2,I am Android developer running Android studio taking lot of ram also sound problem if I run my emulator making sound not run properly waste of money don't buy it
553,3,Booting time is high.. I recommend to add an SSD and move windows to it. Otherwise nice laptop for entry level gaming and editing...
554,3,Battery life is too bad
555,5,Good laptop for this price
556,4,Speed is slow compare to others due to HSD however SSD can be further install.Display is very good and keyboard light is also attractive. Over all its good product in this price range.
557,5,Value for money
558,4,Laptop is good for mid graphl
559,3,This is a good product In terms of value for money. But I face a problem which is Slow boot. I write this review after 4 month Continue use. Go for it But Mind it Insert a Ssd for batter experience
560,5,With 8gb ram its really hard to play games. Upgrade to 16 gb for best performance
561,5,Good laptop at all üòäü§üüí•üî•üíØ
562,5,"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb"
563,3,Am graphic designer. After using 1 month of photoshop. Lot of hang issues. So any one buy for designing purpose. Go for Ssd version. Not this. But apart from designing. It's really good.. üòá‚úåÔ∏è. Im telling only for designing people's. Not everyone.
564,5,Looks so premium can't go wrong with this
565,3,"Purchased as per the spec but it takes too much time to boot, recommended to have SSD"

591,5,Wonderful product  It's awesome üëåüëåüëåüî•
592,4,everything is good in this price range.. just U have to add an extra 8gb ram to run smoothly.. no other choice.. extra around 2500 rs for ram... and u should know that 2gb ram already reserved for system usage.. it means even if u upgrade the ram upto 16 gb still u can use only 14gb... just mind it before buying it.. and it matters.. üòï and while charging the charger getting heated so much.. I dont know it only happens to me or others too..
593,1,"Some games are lagging , i dont know why this is happening. I am not impressed regarding this product. Build quality is not good . heat control is no doubt good. Battery average. Charging cable is too small.. No colours variety is available, disgusting black Colour."
594,5,"Graphics ard is Nice Display is Nice Everythin is nice except 3 points 1. Startup problem (slow) 2. Batter life is too less (2/3 hrs during general use , not gaming) 3. Speaker volume is too low (almost half than other PC)  Every other crieteria is good Value for money Only Battery and Speaker disappointed me.. (Have to buy external speakers or Headphones)"
595,5,This is the best gaming laptop at this rate.. It's performance is very good display is also grate But the only problem is there is no ssd so booting time is slow
596,1,Got a cheap and used product usb ports doesn't work well if you try to transfer any file from mobile or pendrive it will show you 24 hours of time and Internet doesn't work either please don't purchase it from this seller
597,4,"Everything is good except the hdd feels slow,if you are buying this ,buy a 128 gb ssd minimum."
598,2,Everytime i am paying valorant after 3-4 minutes the screen is showing locking & shuts down... After 1 months of use the screen is getting backlight bleeding & dead pixels
599,5,"This is a great laptop, specially for gaming. I played COD World War 2 and Far Cry 5. Amazing experience. You can upgrade it with SSD to. I Highly recommended it."

610,5,excellent product
611,5,"The booting speed is very low i think add a ssd that problems will be solved. Battery backup is not much as i expected, and the usb ports are only 2 in this laptop that's the one problems i facing, but the laptop is very much better to compared some other products because in this price range gtx 1650 with 4gb graphics card is not available in any other laptops so if you want 60k budget laptop the buy this"
612,5,It's one of the best in the market I bought it and planning to save some money and then add a ram 8 gb stick and an SSD 256 gb and yeah it's awesome value for money.
613,2,"Not performing as expected , 40 - 60% ram utilisation was going for OS , There is minor lag in games too like asphalt 8"
614,4,"It's been two week since i have used it. For a price of 53k it a value deal.  Shadow of tomb raider: 30-40 fps (Medium settings) Witcher 3: Plays flawlessly in medium settings Total war 3k: 30-40fps (medium settings)  Just slap on an extra 8gigs ram and most games would run 30-40fps at medium settings.  Thermals: I played continously for 7-8hrs, it never throttled. Never expected this from a laptop at this price range, really outperforms. :)  Multitasking: Since the ram is limited to 6gb ca..."
615,5,"Everything is perfect but battery is good having average 4to 5hr. Due to absence of ssd it takes 40 sec to boot up ,it can be improved by inserting a ssd."
616,3,"It is a very good laptop. I am writing this review after one week of delivery. I used this laptop and found some cons. The battery life is very low and the 8 GB ram, we provided by 5.8 GB on which we used and the other 2.2 GB is locked for hardware. Due to lack of ssd this laptop is slow working and boot time about 25-35 sec.  But overall this laptop is great."
617,5,Nice product
618,5,"This is an awesome product, hughly recommended!!"
619,3,Good
620,4,Battery performance is good but Charing is too slow. All this are good. Design is very sleek. Color is nice
621,4,"Laptop is good but sound is not good and also reeboot time is too long to start the laptop, otherwise all good specially display is osm"
622,4,A ssd would be a better option. Battery is not as good as other laptop. Performance is not very great. Still.its fine.
623,4,"The product is very good and the performance is best in my opinion, battery life is also last longing according to my need."
624,5,Purchased for my younger son. He is absolutely happy. So I got the value of purchase.
625,5,Great Display and Sound quality .  Overpowered gaming but only problem is that the usable RAM is 5.92 GB.  You can add RAM and the AMD Ryzen 5 is a total beast .  Love the finishing and overall 4.5/5
626,5,Awesome ProductüíØ‚ù§Ô∏è Recommended for UI DESIGNERS!
627,5,This is nice product but I don't have my warranty card
628,5,Super ! Worth each penny
629,5,This is a good gaming laptop under this price range.
630,5,nice
631,5,Fantastic product with fantastic price point...
632,5,"Very nice,, ???"
633,1,"I dont know what the issue is but the performance is very very poor,the booting takes almost 45sec,games are unplayable,also it crashes a lot. For some weird reason the usable ram i get is only 5.88 gb out of 8gb. Opted for the return option,but weirdly flipkart has only replace option,that too with only the same product. My friend just bought the same product,he is facing the same issue! Update:- received the replacement unit, still a shitbox,slow af,i guess the whole lot is defective"
634,1,The main reason for giving just one star is nothing but their amd on board gpu which reserves 2gb of the total ram in the system which seriously affect the gaming performance. Overheating is another issue.
635,1,performance too much slow. don't buy this product .it's waste of money
636,1,The product is not good with 6 gb ram but if you add another 8 gb of ram and 256 gb of ssd then it is a beast.
637,5,Very slow processor
638,2,Takes too long to start... High graphic games lag
639,2,cant play gta 5 smoothly with this 6gb ram a lot of lag occuring
640,1,Battery back up has been reduces to 2 hrs with in 2 weeks and laptop charge rate is 6% per hour
641,5,4days of USAGE AND in short. This laptop can be used for multitasking(coding apps) and runs fairly smooth...boot time approx 45secs and build is amazing. But there is a sluggish and conventional old laptop feels from the start..Its is kind of slow and in the promotion of the laptop benchmark says COD WARFARE runs at ultra high but the laptop doesn't even run the game smoothly like lobby and all...Gaming experience is bad when its online. Have already updated my bios and all but its pretty bad.
642,1,"screen bleeding issue noted, i return"
643,4,Due to the hdd... it's boot time and app opening time is slow but overall it's ok for a budget gamer.... The design is awesome as a gamming laptop but the top flex is visible. Built of the top is slightly disappointing. But the overall the built quality is ok. The huge disappointing thing in this laptop is that the usable ram is only 5.4GB out of 8 gb I'm very disappointed for that.
644,2,"I wanted to write this review because there are couple of things not worth.  1 Design is awesome. 2 Sound is awesome. 3 Display is awesome. 4 Performance disappointed me, I bought the laptop two days back and it‚Äôs hanging many times. Even before checked game performance. single HD movie also hanged many time in two hours.  Before buying this laptop please check other laptops in this price range and compare with hardware."
645,1,Very slow laptop
646,1,Don't buy this model. Boot time is above 3 min and the laptop is laggy
647,1,The Laptop is good But the Service of Flipkart is extremely poor
648,2,"I purchased this Laptop looking at all the reviews, and also after going through expert comments and reviews on different websites. I really like the design, look and aesthetics of the Laptop.  However, when it comes to performance, I am terribly upset with the boot speed. I understand this doesn't have an SSD, but even with a Hard Disk, that too with the specs that his Laptop comes with, taking close to 2 minutes or more to get to the Windows 10 logon screen is too much. Moreover after loggi..."
649,1,I had buy this laptop just some days before. And I'm very much regretted. The battery takes too long time to charge like 3% takes 30 minutes. And the laptop is very very slow and taking too much time to start. And if you play any game it lags very much or even in between game the laptop gets lock. Very disappointed.
650,1,Please don't purchase it because after finding lots of diificulties when I talked to the HP customer care they told me that windows is not provided by them may be flipkart has given windows 10 means hp has provided with simple docs nothing.  Actually I purchased this laptop after reading all the review but what I observed it a very slow battery is ok only and screen gets freezes I think about 50 times with in only 20days and boot up issue. Takes about 1 to 2 minutes to start the laptop after...
651,4,"Battery drains very fast & this laptop is super slow. The main problem is in this laptop it's take so much time to start (one &half minute maximum) & it's folder opening speed also very slow,"
652,2,"The laptop review is written after a months usage 1. Windows home edition does not have ms office which is needed for any student: misleading information by Flipkart/ HP as they should specify. 2. Computer booting takes considerable time feel that I should have taken SSD rather than 1 TB HDD, seems a bit slow in response (maybe due to Ryzen 5 processors when compared to i5) 3. Very heavy weighing laptop 4. Scroll pad does not have separate buttons below so again left and right clicks are hav..."
653,1,DONT BUY THIS...........its very very slow Sometimes it freeze for no reason It take atleast 1 min to startup Cant even shutdown the system  NOT SATISFIED AT ALL
654,1,Booting time is too long even with min loading apps. Apps loading time is also too long. Battery drains too fast.
655,1,Worst laptop of all time. Very slow and battery was a useless and causing issue within 15 days of buying
656,2,Very slow laptop
657,1,"I am using this laptop from 15 days plz don't buy this laptop it stop working, I am pissed of plz buy a laptop to your near storyüò¢"
658,1,"Worst product , Device not getting on after installation Just one day of use , laptop turned to be useless"
659,1,Very very slow üòí performance. Slow processor very disappoint
660,1,"Modern laptop need more fast processing ...but my laptop, haha even lots of upgrades I still found it's like 13 processor...it's very slow processing I am a bit unhappy ,it takes nearly 10 minutes to start,...which system now a days take 10 minutes to get in track ."
661,4,Everything is fine best performance but battery drains fast
662,1,Performance is slow
663,4,Best laptop
664,1,Just to sell the ssd they make made this hdd thing a joke.. If u r willing to spend about 10 K more then only buy this one otherwise find something else. The boot up time and the performance it gives is jst unacceptable. Even opening Google Chrome takes ages
665,3,Man this is one of the best but of your gaming in this laptop. 8 gb ram is not enough you have to upgrade to 16 gb ram or directly buy same laptop with 16 gb ram and the most value for money in this laptop is graphics card
666,1,"Don't waste your money on this ,I am writing this review after 1month of usage, it crashes almost every time ,can,t even watch YouTube on chrom properly , always crashesh, I buy this laptop for gaming and video editing, now I am regretting ü•≤,PLZZ don't buy this"
667,1,It is worst phase and you can say experience of online shopping there is nothing which justify its cost and specifications.This is also a old model so u can buy some new arrivals of any company with great experience.
668,1,Always if you open any program it will show not responding not responding
669,3,"bootup time is around 2 min, horribly slow system"
670,3,If you are really into gaming and want to buy a high performance laptop do not buy it. Never ever go for Ryzen. I won't suggest you ever. I am writing this honest review after using it for a month. Do not buy it.
671,1,Disgusting service from Flipkart and HP.....they stuck my money......third class product they sell
672,2,"A gaming laptop, which cannot survive browser tabs more than 5, while simple apps are running in the background (Spotify, Trello, Telegram)."
673,1,Very slow laptop not working fast
674,1,Boot time around 2mints every time and profomnce not good
675,1,Laptop is getting slow while charging... started after onemonth of purchasing... not getting any help from hp after compalining multiple times... hp is reallyy worse for me
676,1,Battery is week.
677,5,Its very slow boot up time is aprrox 2 minutes also i takes 20 30 seconds to open any application btw good for gaming but very slow
678,2,Please not buy this üôèüèªin 5days it have lots of issues worest battery slow boot time
679,3,Little slow it's giving me reminder of first generation pc black and white once
680,2,Booting Takes Much time (more than 5 min). Speaker sounds are very low. system performance is low.  Display is good. Battery Backup is okk as of now since the use is less and gaming is not done. Could have included SSD Hard disk.
681,4,Good working
682,2,Not really satisfied with the product and the entire process till possession of it. Laptop takes forever to boot up. The response time is very slow. I don't know if you can run games smoothly takes forever to open Chrome.
683,1,heating issue lagging takes forever to load windows 50k wasted
684,2,I was using this laptop since September 2020 it hang a lot
685,5,"Excellent laptop go for it Screen 5/5 Bettery 4:5/5 ,performance 5/5"
686,4,Avarage
687,4,Very good
688,4,"Some softwares seems to be pixelated. Also, I could notice some lag during the file transfer. Multi tasking is not at most good for 8gb ram. It still has to be more efficient."
689,5,"used very well no issue reported as of now, little bit slow due to HDD."
690,5,Very good product..
691,5,Good
692,4,Battery is not God
693,3,Performance is slow
694,3,Best on this price range
695,4,If u r going for gaming then u should upgrade SSD and Ram then it becomes beast.
696,5,Best for Multitasking and multiprocessing
697,5,Better than expected....üî•‚ù§ awesome product
698,4,"Slow booting up with hdd,, but overall good in price segment..."
699,4,Worth the money
700,5,"This laptop is literally amazing. But, a bit slow cause of hdd.. I'm certain it'll get much faster after adding an ssd."
701,4,The laptop takes very long to boot up...every app that I open takes very long to start..I don't know what the problem is...sometimes the laptop just freezes.....and while playing fifa 18 I noticed some frame drops which should not have been....because the GTX 1650 is a great processor....I tried to consult with the hp support ...but they said it's not the laptop defect....it's windows defect
702,1,This laptop is broken down within a month
703,2,"Laptop functions quite slow, starting from power ON. Even same with browsing. I observe buffer. Takes lot time to open application and switch between them.. Not upto the mark. Facing issues while using office tools. Not worth the investment of 55K."
704,5,"i like this laptop ,used outocad and heavy game smoothly"
705,1,I received a defective piece which is not getting on. Display is completely defective. I received this item as gift and hence took 20 days to unwrap. Now Flipkart says you only have the option to contact HP helpdesk. Really purchasing expensive items online for Gifts is risky because 7 day return policy gets overs till the time gift is unwrapped
706,5,"Writing review after using it for 5 months approx. It is best in market got at 49998 only. Used matlab and ansys software it has no lag. Played games like resident evil 6 , gta 5, mafia 3 . It is running game at 1080p at 40-60 fps. No issue of lag or heating is there. After playing for half an hour fan are starting to run but they are giving very cold air so no issue of beat. Temperature of graphic card maximum goes to 55 degree during games. Battery is .out 12 hrs on simple use and 6 hours o..."
707,4,Everything is good except an SSD would make a lot of difference in performance...and secondly the processor is little slower than intel i5 8th or 9th gen. But it is good compared to other gaming laptops in battery backup.
708,1,Too slow.. I used only 1weak.. The Performance is very slow..
709,5,Very good laptop must buy....it is very good for engineering students and fulfilling all requirements which we want for design purpose in this price..
710,1,Very bad to use on multiprocessing.
711,4,This laptop is very good But you have to upgrade the ram and ssd After upgrading it will become beast
712,5,"Excellent for the price but the ram we get is about 6gb, which is enough for day to day tasks but not for gaming... upgrading the ram is a must. HDD is a bit slow but if you want that snapiness in windows you can add an SSD. battery life is ok-ish of about 4 hrs"
713,3,Bro the speed is really very slow like its hangs for like 30sec after i close a game and booting time is 1min 10secs .... If anyone can fix this please let me know coz i had put all my 3 year savings on this laptop
714,3,Battery backup not so good. Games very slow
715,5,I happy with hp laptop and flipkart service. Thank you flipkart
716,4,it takes too much time to boot .it takes around 1;30 minutes
717,1,I got a faulty product.
718,5,Hmm somewht battry issue but performance is beast
719,1,Laptop is getting strucked when I use it for more than 3 hr
720,5,Very good laptop at its price range Best design Battery ok No doubt you can go for it
721,1,It heats so much.... unbearable...third class product of HP. Atleast low budget laptops have good performance but this laptop is so bad. It hangs like hell n then nothing happens. Very bad purchase. Nothing goes right with this laptop when compared to its specifications
722,1,I am using this laptop for about 4 months and it had ruined my experience it is worst thing i have purchased ever  it take about 1 minute to start or boot and still after that it get hanged up  i had run many softwares as an graphic designer and every time it screwed up at every last moment and  as for hp support they always tell to reset the pc on every call and every update never download properly  As for heating concern it heats alot if fans are not given it may explode Very cheap qual...
723,1,The delivery boy was a bit rude ...Design display and battery is good...but it seems a bit slow after updating the drivers it's ok ..booting time is 40-60 sec ..maybe due to less ram(6gb and 2gb Vega graphics) and HDD..after upgrading ram and adding ssd ...This will be a beast... everything else seems good..no heating problem..so if u think about this laptop this is ok and after upgrading with about 6-8k it will give best performance...like if you want any updates ....  After 10 days of u...
724,1,Laptop dead on arrival
725,1,Worst product Very slow
726,5,Without ssd it's very much slow buy yah it's performance worth
727,2,The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.
728,3,Go for ssd varient It lacks even in bluestacks
729,2,After 6 month of User It‚Äôs really slow Takes lot of time to start
730,1,"I'm writing this after using it for 5 months.  Considering the configuration it has, the laptop is extremely slow. It takes nearly 3-5 mins just to switch on (even after minimizing almost all startup apps after consulting HP Customer Service. App loading is very slow. While playing game as well, game stutters (FIFA 19). So, performance wise, not at all good.  Looks is great. Keyboard backlight looks attractive, however you can't keep backlight on all the time as it consumes reasonable batter..."
731,5,There is only 5.9 gb usable ram in this laptop...
732,4,Battery backup is very low and performance is ok ok.! You can invest 5-10k more and go gor some better option.!
733,5,Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time
734,1,Take so much time for booting... Too slow
735,5,Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient
736,1,Machine is too slow. I think the performance issue is related to hdd and windows 10. Need to wait long time for machine to become responsive else it will show 100% disk usage. Users cant change the bios settings as its locked.
737,1,Worst laptop and worst service by Flipkart
738,4,I bought the laptop for more than 3 months now if you are a gamer go for an upgrade of ssd which will make your overall performance good The speakers are stunning compare to other laptops the b&o audio took it to the next level Display is epic with the streaming 4k video which is cool 8gb ram only 6 gb usable because of the consumption of integrated graphics card While gaming with hdd face lag issues for nfs payback bit after a bit its okay After a month i face a little bit of crashing issue...
739,3,Battry backup is very poor ... And please do not order this product ...without ssd it has very slow processor...
740,1,Never buy a ryzen laptop Better go for i3 Intel it works better
741,1,This laptop is i am using but this is really working are slowly...i am not happy
742,1,Worst product..
743,1,I use this laptop 1 months its performance are soo bad lak problem software very slow working and so many problems
744,1,Physical memory installed is 8.0 GB but out of it only 5.88GB is usable. They have no explanation about this. They haven't mentioned this in their specifications. Think before you buy.
745,1,Too much from the date of purchase..
746,1,hard disk speed is too slow always shows 100% disk usage and games are lagging like hell.
747,5,The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k
748,1,Laptop generates lot of heat while using it Lags a lot while playing Gta5 Laptop takes 3minutes to boot up It takes 20-30 seconds to respond for a click when there is no background app running. Performance is much less than an average laptop which is half the cost of this laptop. HP shouldn't call this a gaming laptop at all and the price is way too higher for the poor value delivered.
749,1,Hangs alot. Poor performance. Worst battery. Discharged within every 3 hour. Very poor experience. Even copying a single folder of 10 GB from one drive to another take about 1 hour time
750,5,Simply superb üòçüòä
751,2,Be ready to spend atleast 5k extra on this laptop for ssd .Out of the box this is a very poorly performing laptop the reason is the HDD. Definitely need a SSD. After getting ssd now I could run the games with discord open before I could not . Now I could alt+ tab within sec before it would crash. If possible upgrade ram to 8Gb 3300Mhz then this lap is a beast at the prize
752,1,"Very waste product i ever seened before.no customer care support.very very slow .. after 11 days the laptop showing very bad performance.the hp customer cares are not contacting me. After i submit a complaint.very very bad prduct.the flipkart , They do not givinge replacement also.don't by this product."
753,2,Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage
754,1,Very very slow performance üòè. Processor very slow I'm not satisfied
755,5,Best in all way....
756,1,UPON THE EXPIRY OF ONE YEAR DISPLAY STOPPED WORKING AND COMPANY CLAIMED THAT ITS NOT UNDER WARRENTY. VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT BEING A GAMING LAPTOP ALL THE FEATURES MENTIONED ARE TO BE CAPABLE AND DURABLE KEEPING IN MIND THAT IT IS A GAMING LAPTOP. FOR NORMAL USAGE ALSO THE SCREEN STOPPED ALL OF THE SUDDEN AND COSTS ME EXTRA.
757,5,Good
758,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of continuous usage. Very good and nice laptop it has best in class display it also passes the the dead pixel test. Displacement astic performance I play a lot of games in this, CSGO and GTA V.  It can't run call of duty Modern warfare, as ram is only 8GB, out of that too 5.88GB is only usable.  Cons: Ram is low. Only 5.88GB I have the HDD variant, and there is no SSD. So my laptop hangs sometimes, and is slow. Go for the SSD variant  Pros: There is ..."
759,4,Nice product for this budget but get ssd model for faster response and better performance than the hdd one
760,4,Worth
761,1,Worst laptop don‚Äôt waste your money
762,1,Wrost laptop ever
763,3,"Good for gaming, but if you are a programeer as well then its worst. i m using this since a year but never feel its the worth of money ,3 times i done cloud recovery (master reset)  speed is not well even it had 8gb ram"
764,1,Very slow and worst. Pls don't buy this !! Complete waste of money
765,2,"Go for a bit better version of pavilion gaming laptop rather than this one. Only 2 months and I have already replaced a harddisk, frequent lags (too much lagging) and works a bit slow. After windows 11 update it's like potato. Had better expectations from hp. Seriously"
766,1,Very bad product  It‚Äôs super slow and takes 20 mins to start.  Never expected this from a brand like HP‚Ä¶
767,1,"Getting very slow after every 2 or 3 month. Don't purchase, if anyone going for this product"
768,3,"Currently you can find a better laptop at this rate, Avg product, High battery usage if you do some heavy work,  Strong and hard piece."
769,1,its too slow after 3 months of use
770,1,Waste of money...!! Never buy this seeing anyone's review...its bad and slow after 3 months u will regret buying this laptop
771,5,"Have been using this for few months now and am loving it. The experience, reliability, and the large screen makes it really cool!"
772,2,"Haven't download any software still hangs a lot after 7months of usage the disk, CPU and memory space always goes to 100"
773,2,Too much hang
774,4,It is very powerful but because off hdd it is litely slow but no problem it Play gta v very easily in any setting
775,4,"Good budget gamming laptop from hp,I am happy with this laptop,"
776,5,I am using this laptop for 1 year now best value for money
777,1,Better to go for acer aspire 7 or ssd variant...I am Facing lot of issues. Worst perfomamce..
778,1,The worst laptop you can ever buy it has ram issues hp support also not able to fix my solution and you will only get 80 90 fps in valorant
779,5,So lets keep it simple fantastic product unless the vents at below it are open enough For gaming can handle everything And If u gaming try rising the laptop slightly to open up the vents which will make the performance noticeable way better multitasking will improve and the hdd kinda slow but when it also given enough breathing room will perform just well so prefer slightly rised like a cardboard roll shud do just fine Overall 10/10 its epic and the specs are just fine to stream and record...
780,5,"This is amazing I can use this laptop no lag,not any issues best laptop I think everyone buy this laptop"
781,5,"Great product , superb result , happy with the purchase ."
782,3,"This laptop has a Nvidia 1650 graphics card but by default internal onboard graphics is preferred by laptop for games. You need to change this setting in Nvidia control center to use Nvidia for graphics and games. Major downside of this laptop is it comes with 5400 rpm hard-disk, which causes it to perform very slow. For those who got this laptop with SSD, no problem for them, but for remaining they need to buy additional SSD to get decent day to day usage performance from this Laptop. Fina..."
783,5,All things are good and best But SSD is must Minimum 256gb Overall performance is very good....
784,4,For HDD varient this laptop is as slow as a Turtle..... But after installation of SSD this is really good one.... and look is awesome...
785,2,Very slow product
786,5,"If you want a Gaming performance I insist you guys to install a Solid State Drive (SSD).......But if you are a normal user this laptop is really more than enough for your needs.....  Plus Points:- ->Very Good Design ->Less weight compared to other with same specifications ->All in all Laptop ->Elegant backlight  Limitations:- -> As it is Plastic body material, it is very often to get untidy.....frequent cleaning is required -> Always good to install SSD to get beast performance -> Camera cla..."
787,1,Worst Laptop For gaming or daily use too. So much hanging issues and lagging issue and booting issue too.
788,1,"Always hanging, not always showing not responding"
789,5,hard disk is slow...you can install ssd must
790,1,Bit battery backup is low
791,5,"In short I would say, WORTHY!"
792,1,Worst model
793,2,Very slow
794,3,"Laptop is powerful and hardware is best,but the quality of hard disk is so bad,it crash in 1year after buying,i reccomend you to buy the its ssd version or you can upgrade to ssd after buying."
795,4,On this price....good performance ü•≥
796,3,Hdd are very sloww.
797,1,"Laptop is tooo slow on both off and on, lag while watching movies, lag on process, many apps and software are not responding"
798,1,"Very bad item, it's got stuck every time and responding time is tooo large it's totally waste of money pls üôècheck before you buy"
799,5,Value for money
800,5,Should update Ram and Ssd to avoid slow performance. Other than that every thing is good
801,2,"DONT BUY HDD.go for SSD. day 2 laptop got automatically shutdown and when it came up, there is no operating system. I had to buy it for my own money."
802,5,Good Performance Laptop
803,3,All things is good but performance is down when playing games charger heating and lagging during high games
804,5,Satisfied.
805,4,"Good purchase from Flipkart, a bit slow even after with SSD so far good experience with the product"
806,5,It's very good.. Worth of money
807,2,"Slow start ,"
808,4,Worth the money
809,3,It was really nice I like it
810,4,There is one important thing about this laptop that is- If you add more ram upto 16gb and Ssd then this laptop is fantabulous. Warning!: Atleast 12gb of Ram is necessary to Run best of tour games.
811,3,It takes too much time to boot up.
812,3,Ok
813,2,Gaming performance was very good since it uses the graphics card. Rest of the normal day to day performance was very bad. The pc runs very slow and lagging even when you open a browser.
814,5,ITEM DELIVERED INTACT AND PERFORMING SATISFACTORILY TILL DATE. NO DEFECT FOUND AS I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR LAST 12 MONTHS.
815,5,Very good but take some time to booting
816,4,"Amazing laptop, but slower because of HDD, if my budget was more I would have bought same laptop with SSD."
817,4,I think because of HDD this product is getting too slow running
818,5,"I gave performance 4 star because the hard disk version is a bit slower but if your budget is under 50k definately buy this laptop its everything what you need , gets the work done , i had many dilemma's while buying my own laptop , if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask me ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

820,3,Should buy it.......!
821,4,Good product
822,5,Satisfied with this purchase.. Don't expect much from a ryzen 5 processor but powerful enough for programming and coding.

831,2,"It needs ram and ssd ,afterwards it's best , otherwise it's booting time is so long also, sometimes it may hangs"
832,5,Amazing Laptop for mild gaming...If you are not a professional gamer and just wanna play for fun this lap. is highly recommended...Even good for coding!!...best at this range ...and it's design is just lit!!!..ü§üüî•
833,1,Some of my internal parts are replaced by other quality less old parts .I just found out this today when I just opened it because of its very poor performance and I was shocked.if I found out earlier in the time of before replacement surely replaced it.and I would never buy a another product from Flipkart because then will never hesitate to fool me again
834,5,can we use pentab with this laptop ?
835,3,I work with android studio. But this lap can not run emulators. It a bit laggy than expected. I wont say its bad but could be better. If you are looking to do heavier tasks go for another higer ones.
836,4,Just upgrade with SSD then it's great
837,5,I am using this laptop from last 6 months and I must say it worths. If you are looking for gaming laptop then this laptop will the best option for you. You will neet to upgrade with SSD. You can use it for official work also
838,5,Good
839,5,I love it
840,4,ONE THING . The Warrenty.. Got a new one and instead of 12 months of warrenty it has only 8 months warranty left and . PC opened 4 months ago for just one day and even in your Hp site you cannot dispute the Warrenty issue because HP says it's not a Consumer product but a Business product.. No Idea what to do about this. And also system is slow and gets hanging simultaneously. Display is good. Sound is not good and loud as expected.
841,4,It takes too much time to start
842,5,Good
843,1,‚Ä¢The Processing speed is very slow ‚Ä¢Booting and Loading takes much time ‚Ä¢Overall looks are good   Is this because of the running of automatic windows updates !???
844,1,Not buy this product Buy ssd laptop
845,4,Great design and performance. A bit slow boot time.
846,2,"Worst laptop, very very slow processor don't buy it"

852,1,Worst laptop don't buy it at all
853,1,Poor laptop
854,1,In last 6 months it has crashed twice. How can HP make such a product
855,5,Good gaming & design product in budget
856,2,"Very slow performance, it can irritates. If you buy it be patient while working on itüòÅüòÅüòÅ and it's not an gaming laptop performer.."
857,1,Speed Not good.
858,4,It is a very good laptop. Very good in this price range. Don't have too much expectations as mentioned in some other reviews. Only problem is 5.9 gb ram ( 2.1 gb is reserved for integrated GPU.
859,3,average
860,4,You Must have to upgrade the laptop ram for playing high specs games like GTA V and others. BTW nyc design and performance..
861,4,GOOD FOR GAMING AND VIDEO EDITING.. BUT RAM UPGRADE IS NECESSARY FOR REACHING ITS POTENTIAL... ALSO SSD UPGRADATION FOR FASTER BOOTING TIME AND PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT..... RYZEN 3550H ITSELF IS A GOOD BUDGET PROCESSOR FOR MEDIUM- HIGH GAMING BUT THE PROCESSOR ITSELF TAKE UP 2GB OF RAM AND THE INSTALLED APPS ALSO CONSUMES MORE THAN HALF OF THE RAM SPACE..WHICH LEFT THE USER ONLY 2-3GB OF SPACE... SO BETTER TO UPGRADE... ITS LACKS LIKE HELL IN JUST STOCK 8GB RAM. OTHER THAN THAT THIS LAPTOP IS...
862,5,Really very good
863,4,Nice performance but sometimes get stuck when am working on my office domain.. I don't think it's good for gaming purpose... I am giving review after one year of use.. in between battery was draining very fastly.. but customer care helped and resolved quickly.. Tbh look is very cool but sharp edges are there.. packaging was very nice and safe also the delivery was on time... Thanks
864,1,I been using these product it's completely slow not worth of money you may regret after buying these product
865,1,"Slow working battery drain,"
866,5,Worth it
867,1,"Performance is pathetic while working with AI or photoshop. I think Flipkart is worst in handling fake product supplier, I think Flipkart actually receives handsome margin through supplier that‚Äôs why promoting it through its platform"
868,3,System is good but booting time it takes around 55 seconds and while updating windows system becomes very slow.
869,5,Requires SSD for better performance
870,5,it's so impressive and value for money... Overall it's showing great performance but u have to add ssd for better performance in gaming...
871,3,Poor performance
872,3,Frame drop happens when we play gta 5
873,4,With a ram and ssd....this is a true beastüî•
874,5,"The laptop is good the build quality is awesome and display,battery etc are excellent but you will get disappointed of the performance it takes around 5 minutes to boot it up and it lags even while using chrome with multiple tabs. Hope it will be better in the ssd version of the same laptop"
875,5,nice
876,3,"Well, the laptop could run GTA 5, with basic graphics. But, whenever I felt the game froze in the middle, I had to restart the laptop. The NFS Rivals car game ran very well, with minimal graphics. Crypto mining is not possible as the GPU only has 4 gb ram. Min you would need 6 gb for those kind of activities.  The boot time is a staggering 2 minutes 20 seconds and it's frustrating. The one I got was a replacement unit. Originally received one has defective display.  Waiting for the warranty..."
877,5,Good product
878,5,Nice
879,4,Nice product
880,3,The laptop is very slow

883,3,Average performance
884,1,Waste of money
885,5,It is so slow better to take ssd
886,5,We r really happy to purchased the HP pavilion by flipkart. Awesome product and awesome online shopping app i.e Flipkart.
887,3,Not so good!
888,4,Everything fine but harddisk little slower
889,2,Its too hanging
890,2,Not what was expected
891,3,Performance is low
892,4,The hinges are looking cool and give this laptop a cool look but in day to day usage they create problem. Screen is shaky cz of these hinges . Also there is no ssd i highly recommend if u are going to buy this laptop purchase a ssd soon. Overall laptop h fine. Gaming performance is great .
893,4,Good

895,5,Value for money product
896,1,Very slow performance.I am not happy with this product. So you don't buy it and go for other except HP.
897,3,Process is very slow
898,1,"Very poor laptop from HP. The design itself is faulty as the charging point location is bound to create problem due to its positioning on the laptop. Battery itself has been ok but it is difficult to get it charged. Display is ok but again due to design the screen panel vibrates even with the fan speed. With such impressive specifications the laptops takes too much of time to boot. This is for normal functions, i havent even used it for gaming purpose yet. Charger seems to be a cheap third gr..."
899,1,Very bad
900,5,Well good product
901,2,"Processor is very slower , I m not satisfied from this product, I want to change my laptop"
902,5,Best in this segment
903,5,"just upgrade it to 225 ssd, and then it will turn into beast.."
904,4,The laptop performance is not that good... because it requires to be upgraded.it is bang for the buck but without ram upgrade to 16gb and SSD you can't play any good AAA title game even at low settings...this issue is due to 2.1gb ram occupied by Vega 8 integrated graphics and paging issue due to HDD and low ram....go for it only if you can upgrade or go for another laptop...this is not a ready to play gaming laptop...
905,2,Very slow processar. Even after 8gb memory system hangs !
906,2,This product having lagging problem
907,4,Premium looking laptop . ‚ù§Ô∏è Value for money .‚ù§Ô∏è Don't think about it just go for it‚ù§Ô∏è
908,4,After 7 month booting time is so late But you can buying this laptop for more better experience.
909,5,Wonderfull
910,4,Good
911,1,The performance of a brand new unit was pathetic. The purple backlit sucks. The font on keyboard is not comfortable. Had to run a check with HP assistant. I dont recommend
912,2,Not suitable for gamers
913,5,With unique design and Backlit keyboard this looks fantastic..... But on the part of functioning it take a very long time to start... It seriously consumes much time to stable after restart too...
914,5,Awesome Gaming laptop
915,5,Lap is good But delivery is too late It's good working lap Nice design Overall good
916,5,Super laptop at this price segment.
917,3,"If you like to buy this product go right ahead, this is a great budget gaming laptop the two downside of this laptop is out of the 8gb ram you are getting only 6gb usable the rest is used by the system so i will recommend you to upgrade the ram with atleast 4gb or 8gb ram stick and the second downside is that the 5400rpm hdd is very slow so i will also recommend a 512gb ssd upgrade for gaming"
918,3,The screen was not working . Chk before you take this product. Hope i get a replacement of a gud quality.
919,5,If you want a gaming laptop.You can definitely go with this laptop.But keep a thing in mind that it has a integrated graphic card which is AMD radeon vega 8 so it allocate approx 2GB of the RAM memory so you'll get only approx 5.9GB memory for RAM so heavy games like GTA V needs atleast 8GB of ram then it uses the virtual memory that is not much fast as RAM so you will feel some framedrops if you are a gamer so you have to upgrade the RAM.And also you can't deallocate the memory from the HP b...
920,5,Best laptop
921,4,"It's boot up slow, tools are 40 seconds due to HDD, otherwise it's OK."
922,5,"Don‚Äôt buy it if ur main aim is gaming.it has only 6gb usable ram and for gaming an additional 8gb ram is must.boot time is ok and can be made better with ann ssd.battery,sound and display r just wonderful.if ur going to college and want a gaming under budget I‚Äôd suggest u to go for it"
923,5,Great laptop for daily office use. On time delivery. Genuine product. Good packaging.
924,5,Worth of money
925,5,"Absolute beast keeping in mind the budget of the device.  I do not play games, rather I bought his for product and graphic design.  Adobe suite works flawlessly. 3 d modelling software works without any issues. Heating could be a issue while performing 3d rendering, suggest using a cooling pad to keep temp. In control.  On stock hdd ..boot time is more..suggest to upgrade to ssd and ram upgrade from hp service centre ..in order keep warranty intact."
926,5,Design super Sound quality super Display normal Battery usage super Totally value for money this product
927,5,The best.... Every penny was worth spending.
928,5,Loved it‚ù§Ô∏è

932,5,Thank you
933,4,Speed is slow but value of money for hp laptop and I suggest go with ssd varient
934,1,Speakers are not working !!
935,4,It's good device in this price range packed with a good graphic card sleek design and a pretty decent processor the only and biggest draw back lack of ssd though you can cop it with a additional sum of 5000 bucks by adding a ssd ( got with nvme m.2 ssd) and you will be left no complaint.
936,5,good look and performence
937,3,No SSD - makes loading new software very slow. Else good product.
938,1,I review this product when not added extra ram or ssd the performance may vary on adding them.Pls don't buy this product if you want üôè good performance it is not worth this price.pls go for intel i5 for this price range. I can't even open the task manager quickly when nothing is opened.pls hear my review. I felt very much for purchased this product. Many reviews says that it is a performance beast but i dont think it is a performance beast. I didn't take care of those negative reviews now i...
939,1,"They say it have 8gb RAM but 2.1 gb is hardware reserved So actual usable ram is 5.9gb only. I have use it for 3 months, lags during playing game even when using gpu. Battery life is not up to the mark. Overall its not worth the price."
940,4,good
941,5,Good product
942,5,best laptop
943,3,It is laptop with good spec but the one and only thing you have to do is to upgrade ur m2. Nmve ssd to have a good performance and bettee booting time. And with this lap we can play games in a 60p frame per second but it takes some more time to open because of the hdd in the lap. Battery backup is good as it can last over 3.5 hrs min and 5 hrs of maximum timing.and the backlit keyboard is the feature that i found very much useful and also looks great in night time. Overall its a performance g...
944,5,Best gaming laptop in this range..... As everyone said u need a ram and ssd for best performance
945,5,Best hp laptop under this range
946,4,if add the additional SSD in this spec then will be seen a good performance
947,5,Good product

950,5,Too good
951,5,Value for money üí∞
952,5,"Worth the money. SSD only gives 15-20 fps, without that itself its a beast, but some few lags in some point."
953,3,Nic laptop But it's booting time and performance is slow
954,5,"Using for 3 days now.... So far so good. In a budgeted gaming laptop, I guess it is one of the best you will acquire if you go for it."
955,5,Performance beast ... But needed a better battery capacity...
956,5,Nice but not that much
957,4,Laptop is very good but the hard disk variant is slow but once you installed a ssd in it you will the beast performance.

965,5,"What a powerful and sturdy laptop. Build quality is very impressive. I bought the 8gb version. Can upgrade to 16gb with another slot that supports 8gb ram. Ssd can also be installed. Performance wise it's ok, as I use it for editing purposes, takes time to render even JPEGs. But I think once upgraded to its full power and windows, softwares shifted to SSD, then it will be a real solid beast. As of now am loving it very much and it's a value for money buy. One thing that I found odd is the key..."
966,5,God
967,1,It was very slow by starting and slow performance. Simply don't waste u r money on this laptop.
968,4,Nice product but i feel like without ssd the performance is not satisfying.
969,5,excellent
970,4,Honest Review! This laptop is good for normal usage and light gaming purposes though it is very slow without an external SSD .So I would really recommend you to get a SSD and if possible upgrade the ram to 16 gb for flawless gaming.Sound quality is decent and video quality is sharp.
971,5,This is a budget gaming beast
972,1,Worst Laptop I ever purchased Don't Buy It Pls Waste of money It hangs too much
973,5,Complete value for money product Very much satisfactory performance
974,1,"Received already used and defect product ,applied for return but it's mentioned more than 15 days for replacement"
975,3,"The Laptop is good but since there is no SSD, the bootup time takes much more than the expected time (Approx 4-5 Mins). The company is also not providing the MS Office lifetime access (which we have to pay separately). Sometimes even the responding time is also slow. Sometimes the type c port is not working properly for transferring files and for charging. There is no global warranty for this product."
976,2,The product wasn't expected..and also support not at all in time.
977,5,Very good....
978,4,"The laptop was superb. But its bppting is not too fast ot takes about 30-1 min. 3-4 days aftet buying there was a problem that i cant open setting, taskbar, windows etc. So i rebooyed it. But now its working excellent"
979,5,Best Product
980,1,It's the worst gaming laptop ever don't buy it.
981,4,Everything is ok but it take time to open sometime good value of your money
982,1,This is the worst laptop that anyone can buy for gaming after a year the system is super slow... majority time there is a huge FPS drop while playing games.... it can not take heavy application during work time.... dont buy this Laptop u will be wasting ur money
983,2,Very poor quality performance...not worth it
984,4,"I have been using this for over 4 month now. It has geniunly stood up for my needs Been doing some coding and cad drawing using solidworks  Works just fine with this graphic card.. Rendering speed is good but 1) u will need a ssd asap At this point takes around 3 minutes to start and lags for some seconds too. 2) this does not include office 3) has macafee antivirus for only 21 days  Other than that coders, designers, students. If you are on a budget go for this one. Best of luck"
985,1,Please don't buy???
986,5,Good for normal editing and gamingüéÆ
987,4,Ssd is the real need and 8gb ram if possible
988,4,Good
989,5,Love this product. My first laptop.
990,5,Honest Review  Just one thing  Add one more 8GB ram stick and bammm. U r good to go. Every single game runs at 60fps on high setting. Even RDR 2. Best laptop. Doesn't feel need of 4600h. This is enuf.
991,5,Great design with better performance
992,4,Everything is good but disappointed by flipkart delivery  I was told it would be delivered by 11 am but delivered at 4 pm
993,1,Very slow laptop. Dont go on configurations...the new laptop OS is very very slow. Pathetic. With time it became more slow
994,5,"Very good laptop for gaming, runs gta 5, fifa 19 , COD and many games smoothly, for games like cyberpunk upgrade the RAM. Upgrade RAM and get an SSD and this is a BEAST."
995,4,Aavarage system running slow
996,5,If you are buying this product then buy a ram card and ssd with it it'll become beast after upgrading.
997,5,Very Well Featured Laptop
998,1,One of the worst experiences ever it's been almost over a year Very slow boot time Lag experience for gaming as well as general use It takes so much time just to open a folder
999,5,Sorry to say this The flipkart coustomer care are not responding properly when it need Am facing the issu with charger It's sparking wile charging cable connected to laptop. Am raised a request several time to Share my issue They are rising a request for call Also schedule time but not a call or massage recived from connesernd.
1000,5,The delivery was fast and packing was good.
1001,3,Laptop is nice but the delivery of ekart is not good they damaged my laptop by applying hook on box which is very bad thing
1002,5,Amazing product start very fast without sad there is a slot for sad that you can upgrade. Design is awesome most of this violet purple you will love it. Go fot it.
1003,4,Laptop is okay . But some times it become unresponsive when I use premier pro. 2gb Ram is acquired by the CPU for iGPU. But it's value for money if you can pls upgrade ram and make partitions in HDD. It's perfect but some time it lag away.
1004,4,The laptop was nice and all things are good and worth.but there is issues because of HDD lagging issues. But there is a slot for SSD also. While i set the SSD it was a good experience and no more lagging. So while you buy the laptop you should add ssd in it.
1005,5,good
1006,5,"This laptop beast needs to be evolved. For 50k price, design, finish, core, display and graphics are great. All it needs is a 512gb m2 nvme ssd with another 8 gigs ram. One of my best buys in flipkart so far."
1007,4,Prosser is poor but value for money üí∞
1008,1,"The windows 10 got corrupted, so i had to spend a ransome amount of money to install a new one, plus the sound system is not working, plus the camera wont open, totally disappointed."

1011,5,Nice one for all
1012,5,"Initially i was fed up with my selection, even after adding 8GB of RAM & 1TB SSD, But once i moved the OS to SSD this becomes beast, excellent performance and awesome speed, Still battery will be a problem, but you cannot expect more that this from this budget and configration,  Worth buying..!!!"
1013,4,Really great product üî•
1014,5,Budget laptop. Overall nice..
1015,5,"Due to HDD, performance wise it's bad. Other than that it's worth for money.."
1016,4,"Reviewing after 10 months Yeah comparing wd the price the laptop is a beast. No battery problems yet, No heating or lag issues...yeah but for increasing gaming experience you definitely need to change some power options which u can easily get on YouTube. I've also made some changes in amd control panel which boots performance. What I liked the most is it's cooling system. Talking about issues...yeah sometime I get this weird lowy bell sound coming up in sleep mode or idle mode...i seriously ..."

1021,5,Amazing laptop ..... Just you need to update all driver's and perfomance will enhance 2x .... No heating issue... If you want super fast laptop just upgrade 250 GB SSD worth 3k
1022,5,Superb
1023,5,"Best laptop for mechanical design softwares , go for it"
1024,2,The laptop is very slow. Not worthy
1025,4,"The product is good.. But as highlighted by many other reviewers, laptop is slow because of HDD. Add an additional ssd for operating system and the laptop will work fine."
1026,5,Phisically it looks much better than pic awesome mid weight laptop
1027,5,Nice laptop
1028,5,This laptop is best in this budget and also this lags a lot but we can fix it by upgrading SSD
1029,5,Super working
1030,4,"Overall a value for money product...does not gets heat,good design and build overall"
1031,3,Booting up and opening an app is very slow
1032,5,"Good laptop at this price range. It does not hv a professional look though, build quality is good. Battery back up is ok."
1033,5,Nice laptop. Performance is very good. But only problem is the loading speed. I know it ls slow because of hdd. But it's slower than average laptop boot. For the 1st boot it took around 25 mins. Then 2nd boot took around 2 minutes. Then it takes 20 to 25 seconds for booting. Screen is quite good and design is too awesome. It looks amazing. Other reviews says its battery backup is not good. But u need to know that battery is too good. I get around 6 hrs backup with 70% brightness and backlit k...
1034,5,This laptop is gaming but you have do firstly upgrade it by ssd And it's battry backup is 2.5 hours at normal use it will be become less at time of gaming
1035,4,Not bad. sometimes laugh when you upgrade ssd and ram it will be good
1036,4,Its work very slow.

1038,5,Good but more laggy and display ausome everything ausome but it laggs more
1039,5,Product is very good. But when I opened for the first time it took almost a hour to open. But overall it's best value for money product.
1040,4,A very good laptop for the price. Totally worth it I am totally satisfied with the laptop. I have tried multiple games and had very little issue as I always run them on full graphic. Use medium settings for higher specifications games and keep graphic drivers updated all time for best performance. I only have one issue that is of battery life. It has very low battery life of around 3-4 hrs. All in all best laptop for gaming and heavy software
1041,5,"Best product Supeb , exllentwork,very fast"
1042,4,"Such a nice laptop in this price range! But I'm feeling little bit slow, while booting up pc and while updating windows os! But otherwise it's super cool and working like a monster. No lag in games! Mainly I purchased this laptop for my development works!"

1053,5,Excellent look but weight is some what heavy
1054,5,Best product!! Worth every penny!!
1055,4,"The product was well packaged. However to optimize this gaming Laptop to its full potential, to play games require more than 4Gb of RAM you need to add another 8Gb of ddr4 ram. For faster performance also add at least 240Gb SSD. Slots to add RAM and SSD is available."

And then update it to the fullest (windows - 5gb + update - 5gb) And you are ready to do what you want. Ram upgrade is also available in future. You dont need it today.

1102,5,"Bought this 4 months ago for module designing it performed nicely slower at the initial but now got updated and its lightning fast without ssd also speed is good, only upgrade needed is ram which is optional now.. its a value for money product playing heavy games and using designing software together it doesn't glitch, i was skeptical about it as first but now i feel it was a right decision. Happy to buy ?"
1103,4,BUILD quality is not so good. hp should think about this. otherwise inthis price this is very good spefication. good laptop. you can buy this.after buying if you add one ssd & 8gb ram then it's perfomance will go another level.
1104,1,Not worth it's price
1105,4,"Not bad , battery drains fast , slow processing not as good as expected buy ssd . ü•∂ü•∂"
1106,4,Best product in the range
1107,5,All Rounder
1108,3,First of all The delivery was late You need to buy a ram stick and a ssd other vise you have to wait a long time to start or reboot the laptop
1109,2,The performance is not great... don't go after this product because of the popularity...The gaming performance is very average... couldn't play watch dogs 2...it's lagging way too much even in lowest graphic settings... disappointed
1110,4,build quality - best plastic speaker - trust me not the loudest but best speaker in this price segment and also beat in terms of 60k laptop trust me you will love it  performance - due to hdd it will lag or slow at time of booting thats hearts üíî  display - no words ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è  and at last there will be frame drop due in gta v due to low ram because the usable ram is only 3 gb out 8 2 gb is used due to amd procceser and out of 6 gb usable is only 3  so if you are going to buy this laptop in 2...
1111,5,Buy without thinking. Excellent product at this price.
1112,4,Everything is good but One thing disappoint that ms office is not pre-installed.
1113,5,"It contains amd radeon 2gb+Nvidia GeForce GTX 16504gb graphics cards.But usable ram is only 5.95gb Disappointing thing is only the matt black colour ut contains alot of fingerprints and dust. Amazing,superb, greatest product.Thermals are extremely good.It contains alreday license of windows 10.Sound quality like a smartphone."
1114,5,Thank You Flip kart
1115,5,"A great laptop on this price range. After using it for 3 days im so happy that i choosed this laptop over acer aspire 7 and msi gf63 thin. Pros: -Great performance. An imperfect Gaming beast -Great thermals, can handle AAA titles within 78-80degrees then instantly cools down back to 44 when game is closed. Which is great for a budget gaming laptop. -less bloatware filled windows . -Great battery backup. Its new but i got a great battery backup of 5hours+ when using it to download my stuffs a..."
1116,2,"This is the worst product i ever used , performance wise it is very slow . If I compare its speed, it is the same as a mini notebook or the same as a normal laptop. If i talk about its speed it takes 30-40 sec to open an excel file. I am very disappointed with its performance . As a gaming laptop it has to respond on just a click.  I have not received any benefit with this product even Microsoft word, excel & power point are also paid software. I am suggesting never buy a laptop through onl..."
1117,1,"Most pathetic, horrible laptop. It lags a lot. A chrome book is better than this. It takes 10 seconds to open firefox browser. When it comes to games...it lags like an old computer. Don't believe that this laptop is for budget gaming by going through the specs. It's a waste of money."
1118,5,Amezing product
1119,5,Good
1120,5,Overall nice product But only thing is you need to upgrade Ram & SSD HDD is slow
1121,5,Very amazing very cool worth of money
1122,3,"After 5 days of usage. This one is pretty decent product, not installed any games. If anyone played games please let me know how is it's performance. However start-up seems slow is it only me or everyone's having same issue?  Overall i can give 3/5 rating for this"
1123,4,Excellent
1124,5,I buyed it for my Son and he loved it
1125,1,It's very slow when we edit videos
1126,1,"Don't buy this product, laptop is very slow as compre to other and it's keyboard and touchpad is also don't work properly other many software problem"
1127,5,Awesome Product Must Buyü§©
1128,3,System is not upto expectation.. very bad experience . Task manager is even not responding some time.. waste of money
1129,4,The laptop is great but the battery is very bad but since it's a gaming laptop battery isn't expected to be good.It is a bit slow though and crashes a lot
1130,4,"After using this laptop continues 8 months I think this best buy laptop in 50K Display is good Screen Flip mechanism is good after 8 months by by flapping thousands times hinges are good as new processer is fast with no lag while using laptop or playing game ,pc game I meant like PUBG-PC,COD,cricket19 etc  Yes it consume more battery when you play game or use high spec software.

1133,1,HDD is damn slow.. after a month the system is not booting up. Please don't purchase this laptop
1134,1,Poor quality camera... slow performance... Not at all value for money.. Requested for replacement... Lets see..
1135,4,Actually I read a lot of reviews here and it said it's too slow... Believe me it's not that slow ...You will feel its slow only if you have used a ssd variant before .. Just go for it.. And update your bios and drivers and you are good to go.. I just took off a star for delivery it was a bit slow it took 14 days to deliver the product
1136,3,Okay okay not very good the thing is the likes are great and the battery is also good the only thing which is a problem is its speed its slow and yes I dont mean slowing or a bit slow it's very slow
1137,4,Good prodect
1138,5,It is so nice.... I love this laptop.. It is running very smoothly... For programmers it is the best laptop.... It is also good for light gaming no lack issues show in this laptop.... Nice product... ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
1139,2,Laptop is very slow and it stucked
1140,2,Battery backup is low . Performance is poor.
1141,5,Throw in a nvme m.2 and you are good to go. Either purchase the modal with ssd or install one. Otherwise don't buy it.
1142,5,It's a cool laptop it is especially good for online classes and gaming üëå if you are a student or want to become a gaming YouTube then you should buy this it's pretty cool üòé
1143,1,Don't buy it for higher level works Not good product very slow

1152,2,i am use 2 week but laptop is very slowly open not fast open time 18 second my second pc 6 second open
1153,4,"Decent product , good for gaming , don't even think for buying it for daily purposes"
1154,5,"Loved it, awesome product. üíñ"
1155,4,Very good laptop for desent gaming
1156,5,Nyc laptop It's working smoothly Design is also good
1157,5,My keyboard was faulty
1158,3,Heating and lag issue...
1159,1,"Not a good laptop, built quality is low, very slow"
1160,5,Nice good laptop
1161,5,Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance
1162,5,Good laptop for casual work and gaming
1163,5,Once it will taking lot of time for booting but it's assume look and quality when we will upgrade ram and ssd it will become a beast laptop happy to buying beautiful laptop. When I received small bending in touch pad but it working so I didn't replaced for very small bend it works nice
1164,5,It's the beast go for it
1165,4,This product is great in the price range of 49K. I would suggest to upgrade ssd and ram after purchase as it will turn this into a more powerfull machine. The only shortfall I found was the fact that bios locks the advanced settings area which limits ram of this lap to 6 or 5.8 gb and wastes the potential of 2 gb in igpu which is not needed as it has a dedicated gpu as well
1166,1,I got a hang issue from the beginning. Now its 3 month's and it's still the same
1167,5,beast laptop at this price
1168,5,Definitely add a SSD to it... Otherwise the lap is too slow to boot up and run... Its a plus to add up to 1tb ssd upon the inbuilt HDD.
1169,3,This laptop is very good but other 0battery is very bad for me only one hour play game I am suggest a pc for gaming but this is good
1170,5,good
1171,5,Great after 1 week of use
1172,3,"Everything was okay except the performance is slow due to HDD, better to go for SDD version"
1173,5,Good products
1174,5,u can use it for normal use gaming and much better battery and backlit keyboard is best
1175,4,Can anyone explain what is this small white light for?
1176,4,3 day used. I purchased this product only for normal purpose and Adobe Photoshop. This is good for me
1177,3,Battery is is week and speed is also slow recommend ssd drive
1178,5,Very good product value for money
1179,3,There is a slowness because of th hard disk which can be fixed by installing a SSD. There is 5.98/8gb is only usable as the processor is apu. But it's not a problem for gaming without streaming. Edit:Gaming is too horrible with the default ram we should upgrade it to get good performance
1180,5,I am totally impressed with this product Worth for Money Under 50k best gaming laptop
1181,5,Beat product in mid-range. Beast of mid-range. If your budget is 50000 i prefer you to buy this laptop. It's a beast.
1182,4,Overall pretty good gaming experience but poor battery
1183,5,Genuinely good product after 1 week of use. Using mainly for programming will start gaming and review later. So far good laptop. I love this gadget.
1184,1,Dnt buy very slow while using cad software
1185,1,Works very slow manytimes real reviews after 3 months
1186,4,It is good... Boot tym is slow... But it could be solved by increasing the ram....
1187,5,Good Product
1188,5,Looks premium but gets oil marks everywhere. Ssd is a must if you want fast loading speed. Upgrade ram also if you do multitasking of heavy apps. Ram frequency 1600mhz
1189,4,Very very good.... I am completely satified
1190,5,I bought this for mobile game development and coding and unteal engine and other apps work smoothly on this . Also gta v runs perfectly. No need to add ssd but yes ram can be upgraded to 16 gb to even more enhance the laptop but without it also it works fantastic.
1191,3,I can play free fire with lag
1192,5,Awesome product
1193,1,Waste of money
1194,4,"When I bought this loptop earlier I thought why it performs very slow like opening applications, loading, taking more time to boot up later, I realised and I added SSD to this after that it will performing like a beast and now it is booting in 15 seconds. I am playing forntine, Apex legends, Minecraft, valorant etc., I didn't get any issues like lagging while playing the games even in 8 gb ram. In future I will upgrade ram to 16 gb but now this was enough to me. Coming to laptop Display quali..."

1198,3,U can fell the lag and don't even dare to install BlueStacks.It'll hang
1199,4,Everything is perfect according to the price but it definitely needs a ssd upgrade Rest all is excellent
1200,4,Beast
1201,5,All rights but boot is very slow
1202,5,It was really a nice product
1203,2,Some game like frozen 4 is not run nice till now bad is that the 8gb Ram is mentioned but 2gb is already use By system we get only 5.88gb Ram usable gaming experience is not good not bad also some game run smoothly but some are not
1204,1,Booting time is to long very slow performance and not worth it
1205,3,Not satisfied with the performance speed...
1206,5,Very nice product . Delivery before time . Satisfying ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
1207,4,Entry level laptop
1208,4,Nice one. Increase ram for better productivity. That's it. People say go for SSD. But it isn't compulsory. HDD works fine as well.
1209,4,Best in value for money...as it's HDD so performance is quite slow
1210,5,Good performance...
1211,5,It is best under prize range
1212,5,Excellent product delivered only with in 2 days
1213,5,"I would say this laptop is value for money, a great machine from HP. Since there is no SSD pre installed, I would say, it would be great if the user installs an SSD after purchasing this device. I have installed an SSD onto the machine and now most of the games I'm getting more FPS and more enjoyable."
1214,1,Charging port loose connection & very slow performance Not satisfied.

1219,3,Product ok but we need to upgrade to ssd
1220,5,Nyc product
1221,5,Battery is not right vrey fast discharge
1222,3,Dont expect too much
1223,3,While running editing softwares for coding or some other big softwares...it slows down coz of the 6gb ram(+2gb internal graphics)...ram upgrade and ssd upgrade can help sort this issue....otherwise 5 out 5 on value for money.
1224,4,Superb quality
1225,4,Gud product and value for money
1226,1,Its slow and already started facing touch pad issues...it's extremely slow...please consider Azus or something else
1227,1,"Without SSD and 8 GB memory the system is unusable.  Having put 256 GB SSD and 8 GB more memory, the system performance is very good.  Not sure why they have not made it default configuration."
1228,4,"Laptop is good for mid-level gaming and official purpose. Design is classy, suitable for both gaming and office.  Recommended: upgrade to 500gb ssd and 8gb ddr4 ram for ultra performance."

1234,5,"This laptop is completely an insane beast,i loved it, the performance is very good and the battery back-up is also good. However, firstly to get the best out of it, please update all the laptop drivers i.e graphics, processor, mother board, bios etc, the updates will take over 2-3 hours on speed internet,  Also, because of of the 1 TB HDD, the performance is quite low, but once the laptop is upgrade to SSD and extra 8GB or 16GB RAM it is completely insane beast.

Display is crisp. Design is great.

1364,5,Booting take long time expect that overall performance and gaming is best  If u add additional SSD it make perfect
1365,4,Product Is good but you should go with Asus because there is only 4 gb ram usable out of 8 gb this is the worst thing of this laptop and delivery is to late so I have cut half half star for both the reason.
1366,5,i will play the free fire very smoothly!
1367,4,Performance very good Battery - 4-5 hours Design very good design with backlight keyboard
1368,5,Good to spend for quality lap

1375,3,Soo good
1376,5,It is a very good gaming laptop. Awesome laptop of it's price..
1377,3,"VERY DISAPPOINTED Given the specs it should work like high end device but disappointed me a lot, it takes time to open any kind of application and if we install any sort of game then device starts hanging."
1378,3,"Without ssd as its boot drive it feels very slow when starting, and sometimes feels like lagging when tried to run few applications at once."
1379,3,"Slow processor ,only 5.9gb ram available."
1380,5,Superb Product... I bought 6 months back.. still no issues. When you run big games its working good not excellent.

1382,5,"V nice laptop but sometimes lags a little, battery is good if kept on balanced and not high performance, all in. One laptop."
1383,4,"Aside from booting issue and ram being only 6gb/5.90 its a great lap. Just place an 500gb ssd and an 8gb ram , its a beast. Spend maybe another like 7-8k for upgrades and this lap will last 4-5yrs"
1384,3,HDD is littile slow it takes more time than expected to boot Display is üëå Recomend adding SSD or SSD varient
1385,4,"Battery life Not as aspect ... but nice product and designing,"
1386,2,"It claims to boot within 30 seconds. That didn't happen. It actually takes longer than my previous 5 year laptop to properly start. If there are any tips or tricks that we are supposed to implement prior usage or take the device to a service centre for tweaks then that must me mentioned beforehand. I don't know if the seller has just provided a sub standard product or the device itself is faulty, the loss is ultimately mine. When I'm paying so much for a laptop then I expect features that are..."
1387,5,Best product
1388,4,"So one thing which I too read in comments before buying that ram upgrade is must, and I total agree, ram upgrade is must to get a beast out of it.ssd is not so much needed. Good Good display Games in high settings runs super cool but ram upgrade is felt. While switching from game to windows. Backlight light is good Speaker are good quite loud Cons battery backup is not good while doing work.

1394,3,"Laptop is best ,, Fantastic degine,but flipkart delevery service is very bad.."
1395,5,If you are looking for a laptop at a rate of 50k this is the perfect choice
1396,5,Super
1397,3,Cyberpunk lagging even after running on low settings Assassin's creed black flag runs at high settings Laptop automatically shut down while playing game at high setting(after 15 mins) Only problem with ram. As 6 gb is usable. Need to upgrade.
1398,5,Good but sometime works slow
1399,1,Very slow. Startup takes 15 mins.
1400,5,"If you are going to buy this order a 8gb 2400mhz ram with it else the ram will bottleneck the GTX 1650 and u may think that the laptop is not efficient, cuz of integrated graphics only 5.88gb of ram available  a perfect classic gamming laptop , u can use this for both professional use and gamming .it doesn't look aggressive as other gamming laptop . Great performance , with hdd it just takes 20 or 19sec to boot up initially Display - is superb it has led display Sound - loud and clear Batter..."
1401,5,Good
1402,5,Product is good.. Satisfied
1403,2,5.58 gb ram only usable pls avoid to buy this laptop Its booting time is not fast it take too much time Design was awsome.but its has only design...
1404,4,Everything seems to be perfect except at this price range we deserve ssd and slightly better build quality . Overall nice experience.
1405,5,This laptop is very good but if u need gaming faster then you need to attach a ssd around 140GB or 240Gb.
1406,4,All good but processing low because HDD. So i recommend buy with SSD
1407,5,Super good
1408,4,Everything is good but it takes long time to boot.
1409,4,Battery is a average factor 3/5... But overall price and features 4/5.
1410,3,Battery not good...only works 3 hrs
1411,4,At this price its worth buying without a second thought.
1412,4,Good
1413,3,Battery in high performance is only 30 to 50 minute
1414,5,Best Product Truly
1415,4,"Good product for basic level gaming, designing, autocad, photo shop and it comes with good price"
1416,3,Don't buy ryzen take intel
1417,5,Just amazing
1418,5,The best
1419,4,"Best laptop for this price range, Best display. Performance is great, it has extra slot for ram and ssd. The only drawback is that hp locked the bios due to this the vega graphics reserves 2 gb ram so only 6 gb ram is usable because of this games like GTA V, Shadow of the tomb raider, RDR 2 stutters (playable but annoying). Upgrading the Ram to 16 gb fix this issues and makes this a bang for the buck."
1420,4,Nice
1421,3,Battery backup is very worst
1422,3,"Average one , battery drain is too fast, much lags we will face even while normal use also."
1423,5,"The laptop is great overall and the GTX1650ti can run most modern AAA games, display is awesome and performance is good... BUT A RAM AND SSD UPGRADE IS MUST... And battery life is somewhat short but that's expected from a gaming laptop.  Get at least a RAM upgrade (if u don't mind longer booting and loading times) and this beast is ready to go"
1424,5,In this price range You can get this as a best deal... the battery backup could be better... otherwise product is best üî•
1425,5,The heating is more and gaming are lagaing But good
1426,5,Received the product within 03 days of placing order. Performance is great considering the price point. AMD does a great job and is comparable to i5 9th gen. Overall recommended.
1427,4,If you are a gaming person than ram upgradation is must. Build quality is upto the mark in this price range .
1428,5,Very nice products
1429,1,"I had an issue as there was a stuck pixel on my laptop and even though it's a manufacturing defect, hp does not want to help me. I'm also under warranty."

1431,4,"Good laptop for the money. Windows is unusable for me with default configuration (HDD, 4Gb ram). Upgrade ram as soon as you get it for better performance on dual channel memory. There is one empty ram slot and Lenovo manual says upto 12Gb total ram is supported. That is 8 GB ram can be installed in the slot. I've only added 4g. Please remember that 2Gb will be dedicated to the GPU and there's no option in bios to change this. So I had only 6Gb available ram for programs and services. It has o..."
1432,5,"Don't waste your money for assemble pcüòé.  It's good to know about laptop thing. Premium budget laptop better than assemble desktops.

1434,3,"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo..."
1435,4,Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.
1436,3,First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...
1437,5,It's a great laptop I got it under 29k best buy for me and just add 4gb ram to it and see the magic happen it's too good
1438,1,I am not satisfied with this laptop.this laptop is working slow. Screen brightness is low. Speaker is not good sound is low.i get this laptop in 26k. After 1 year keyboard and touchpad not working overall i am not satisfied with this laptop.
1439,4,"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k. Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed. If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought. But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.  Pros: 1. Design is good, display is good. 2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen. 3. Comes with MS office 4. Speakers are good.  Cons: 1. Mouse touch pad is n..."
1440,4,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings. Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop"
1441,5,"I think this is one of the finest laptop i ever bought Looks good , best battery backup, performance is very fast with ryzen 3 dual core, Ryzen 3 dual core is far better than Intel i5 10th gen It will give u battery backup of around 5 hrs Go for it guys"
1442,4,"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 3 Processor 2. AMD Vega 3 Graphics 3. FHD Screen 4. Light weight 5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed 6. Looks  Cons - 1. Battery backup 2. TouchPad 3. Webcam  Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good."
1443,4,I SO HAPPY THIS IS MY FIRST LAPTOP THANKS FLIPKART GIVE ME FAST DELIVERY AND GOOD SERVICE THERE IS NO FRAUD FROM FLIPKART YOU CAN TRUST THE FLIPKART
1444,5,"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use. Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series). Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed). I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD. Display is very good with decent viewing angles. 4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
1445,4,"Honest Review  I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.  So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a..."
1446,4,It's really. Value for money. Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities. Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch. 180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage. Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.
1447,5,"A good laptop in the price segment . Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work."
1448,5,Overall a good product for this price!! Display is good. Battery backup is around 4 hours. Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud. Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor. Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.
1449,5,"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general. However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade) The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured."
1450,3,"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work"
1451,4,"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn  One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage. It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)   I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month"
1452,4,Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.
1453,5,It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly
1454,3,first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance
1455,3,Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.
1456,3,"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student."
1457,4,"It's a good laptop, ideal for students and office work. But it's not for coding and programming 4gb ram is less for this. Initially the laptops hangs and a bit slow but after all the security patch and windows update it runs completely fine. Battery life is not as good also AMD processor consume more power and camera is really bad.Also this colour gets dirty very easily. Till now I'm not finding any more problem. I'm writing this review after 10days. I got it for rs.31,990/ at this price this..."
1458,5,"It's not the best laptop I've ever used but it's certainly the best bang for buck at this price. I invested some more into the laptop (added 8gb ram, replaced hdd with ssd) and the performance shot through the roof!  I have two issues though - the display chassis is a little too flimsy (wasn't expecting much at this price anyway), and the display itself is sub-par. I had to calibrate it manually to make it bearable but all's well if ends well.  In short, you can't get anything better at this..."
1459,4,This is my first ever purchase of laptop. I am using it for last 6 months and after that I'm reviewing the product. 1. The battery performance is medium. In power saving mode the performance is better. Upto 4 to 4.5 hours. 2. The screen sometimes become grey so clarity is medium. 3. Dolby sound system is very good. 4. The touch pad system is not upto the mark. It's better to use a mouse. 5. The build quality is also good in this price. 6. For better performance you just need to upgrade the R...
1460,5,"This is not a student laptop, but I would like to say it's also for professionals.  I can perform following things very smoothly:  Web development with .net framework Adobe Photoshop Android development Multitasking Smooth video editing like filmora AutoCAD MATLAB. Etc YouTube professionals work    Below are the issues In short it is not a software developer or engineers laptop. Better you look for i7 + 16 GB ram with 500ssd  -one more thing Ryzen 3 is best as compare to i3 for sure."
1461,5,Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point
1462,3,Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...
1463,4,"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics. And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.  Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf."
1464,4,"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark."
1465,3,"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)..."
1466,4,Pro Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop. Two side bezel definitely look good. R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software. Most importantly it is cheaper than I3. Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.  Cons It made in China. Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop. Screen is brigh...
1467,5,Awsome laptop in affordable range! Must good going laptop for students and basic uses! Package is nicely.. full care has been taken.. Overall its worth it!
1468,4,Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing
1469,4,I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version
1470,4,"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected."
1471,5,"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty. Those who are planning to buy core i3 9th generation may consider it as it's performance is no lesser than i3 8th generation and in most of the aspects of performance and several games, it leads i3 9th generation. One more USB p..."
1472,5,"The laptop is very good in terms of daily office work and study, Do not expect it to out perform the specs. It is a decent laptop which will give you enough to get going. But if you want high speeds and extreme multi tasking, then go for a better one. If Study and office work( Spreadsheets, multiple chrome windows, drive etc.) is your concern then its just fine."
1473,5,I got this laptop in 23k in bbd sale . Design wise this is beautiful laptop but handle with extra care Display of this laptop is not bad it is full hd and too bright but viewing angle make me unhappy other wise gud display.

1474,4,This review is based on few hrs use without any more aap download pre installed windows 10 and ms office this is great but I check battery very keenly because battery is main component of laptop. Use only screen with internet for video backup is 3:30hrs . Use any task with involved processor power . Backup time is 1:45Hrs which is not gud but in this Corona time all laptops and mobile are very high in price no laptops offer this type of specification in this price range design is ok not ...
1475,5,I purchased it for my younger one. Performance is pretty good and I like the way it is slim and handy at this price range.  Recommended product.!
1476,3,"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product."

1500,5,Amazing product.
1501,1,The laptop is average...what's really disappointing is the display...when put on full brightness it still cannot make things bright....bad viewing experience.
1502,5,"I have purchased this laptop on 26.06.2020 , it is very smooth to handle , games can be played , Perfect laptop for daily use I have purchased it for 24990 , Finally you can go for it undoubtedly"
1503,4,"less than decent battery backup (less than 2.5 hrs), other aspects appear ok (used for about one month till date, mainly zoom meetings), sound from in-built speakers could have been louder"
1504,1,"very bad , it hang always ,cant browse even email"
1505,1,Don't Buy.. Very Slow..
1506,1,"Here is my honest review after using this laptop for 6 months(I belong to a technical background)- Extremely disappointed with Leveno. I am regretting after buying this laptop. I hardly had any expectation with this laptop, still I am utterly disappointed. Their technical support team (on phone) is very incompetent and inefficient and unable to understand/resolve my issues on call. The issues I have been facing from day 1: 1. Fan does not work and hence the laptop is heating too much. 2. Blu..."
1507,1,Bad laptop.....lots of problems......it is not good as shown on paper.....not recommended at all.....
1508,4,Good at this price range. Without thinking just go for it..
1509,1,"Very slow, Battery is not good. Drains very fast"
1510,5,"Nice laptop, smooth performance , all should go for it üòÄ"
1511,5,Best in this price range
1512,3,It is good but it is slow
1513,3,antivirus show for one year but given only 1 month .
1514,5,Superb u should go for it.....without any doubt!
1515,5,simply outstanding......top class performances
1516,1,Very very slow... Fully disappointed plz don't buy. My all money is wasted
1517,5,If you have budget of 30k then go for it.
1518,4,It just a awesome laptop in budget range It good for students and for daily work ...üòçüòçüòçüòç
1519,3,Battery backup is low. Sound is not good. Performance is OK
1520,5,Laptop is good but it hangs sometimes. Laptop taskbar comes delay in screen
1521,3,Ok.
1522,1,horrible.stopped working within 3 days.
1523,2,I purchased this product 5 days before.very worst experience...bad battery life..I requested for return the product
1524,4,"Everything's are good, only the length of the charger is very short."
1525,3,"This is a nice budget laptop and looks premium.. But the problem is the battery, if you will upgrade it with better SSD and ram it will give you decent performance. it supports m.2 nvme..."
1526,5,"Design in this range is awesome. Performance is also good for normal work for students. One problem : fan is noisy , now i feel i have to two fan in room one ceiling fan another laptops fan."
1527,4,"Overall Laptop is good under 25 thousand but the problem is with its battery its battery life is upto 3 hrs maximum for normal use battery is not upto the mark and ryzen 3 processor is good for normal use, although it has FHD display but its viewing angle is not good... Main problem is with its battery lenovo should improve it..."
1528,5,nice product
1529,5,awesome look by lenovo and very fast delivery by flipcart it's loveing
1530,2,my touchpad is not working how to fix it
1531,3,"Display sucks, poor viewing angles, backlight burns through the panel  Battery life is under 4 hours  Otherwise great, Disable antivirus and update windows for faster experience, ram upgrade recommend"
1532,2,After 2 month uses it slow.googl app hi 5 se 10 minute mein open hota hai.
1533,4,Best one to this price (23k) the main dispointment was ram its only 4gb. Due to this less ram performance get little bit lower
1534,1,The battery even after charging 100% does not stay for even for 35mins.
1535,5,"Worthy purchase even in 28k. All-rounder performance. Added extra 4GB DDR4 2400 RAM + NVMe m2 128 GB SSD. Now it loads four times faster than out of the box speed. Recommends for students , programmers and media streamers. Yet it plays most of the games having mid range graphics, not recommends for gaming or studio editing purposes."
1536,3,The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.
1537,1,"Don't think of buying this product. Trust me, you will regret to the deepest point. Highly disappointed with not just Lenovo but Flipkart too."
1538,4,A decent laptop for the money you paid üëçüëç
1539,5,Overall good performance no hanging issue sleek slim light small as per latest laptops comes in this price good with lenovo brand I use lenovo 9-8 years lenovo I have face no issue yeah price is fluctuated but good under 26-27k price
1540,3,Display is awesome. Performance bad Battery average. Overall a decent one.
1541,5,It is to good product but one problem is there its battery backap is poor
1542,3,Average laptop. Don't expect it to be decent quick. Opens up applications after more than 30 secs. Would not recommend it for heavy or moderate use.
1543,5,Good
1544,1,"System performance is really pathetic. For opening one web browser will take 5 minutes after clicking it. Not installed any softwares other than operating system and related files. As per lenova service desk, RAM need to upgrade. But i dont think so. Looks like something abnormal with the laptop. Money wasted."
1545,3,4GB RAM IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS DEVICE. IT SHOULD BE INCREASED UP TO 8GB AS SOME PROGRAMS TAKE LONGER TIME IN STARTING.
1546,1,"Don't go for it Bought it before 6 months, not working now!!!"
1547,3,This is bad
1548,1,"Don't purchase this laptop, running very slow after 1-2 week use"
1549,1,That product is low quality. Slow processor.no need to buy this
1550,1,"Don't buy , worste laptop"
1551,1,Laptop is too slow. Even windows 98 pc is faster than this laptop.
1552,1,Within 8 months keyboard is not working properly Full of hang problem s don't by this don't even where to complaint
1553,1,Laptop functioned only for8 months. Never ever buy e-goods thru Flipkart. They won't provide any after sales services. I reported the matter to Flipkart and Lenovo but the matter not cleared even after two weeks.l lost my money.
1554,2,If you sleep this laptop and reopen it takes 30 to 100sec It's very slow Not value for money after 1 month
1555,1,This laptop is very slow working. It taking 3 minutes for starting window. And after start its work Very slow. My money waste for this laptop. I never suggest to any one for buy this laptop.
1556,1,Worst product. Don't buy it. Very slow laptop. Don't waste your money. Go for dell or hp
1557,4,A best laptop at this range... It is very stylishly designed..... Display is good.... Amd ryzen 3 and 8th gen Mcafee is free for one month but they have mentioned 1 year..... Defects are: A cheap quality battery Battery life is tooo low.... Sound quality is bad..... They have mentioned dolby audio but it's tooooo low.... Camera quality poooor.. üò¨ Except this it's the.... Best.... Don't worry just buy it‚ù§üòç
1558,5,Just Upgrade RAM To 8gb and see the performance!!! Budget Gaming!!!
1559,3,"The laptop is very slow and gets stuck a lot but...you can get rid of that problem if you increase the Random Access Memory. In the beginning my laptop was performing extremely slow. Then I added 8GB of the memory (Crucial Brand) and after that the performance improved significantly. 4GB of the memory is inbuilt, so if you add 8GB of that, the memory will become 12GB, which is enough for even gaming. Ryzen 3 processor is nice. So without the increased memory, the Laptop is trash but after you..."
1560,1,Performance is very poor. The newest laptop hangs so badly
1561,2,One of the worst laptops I have seen. It doesnt give the performance of Ryzen 3 processor. It is running far too slow than expected. Dont ever buy this laptop never look at 3.9 rating. Only way to make this laptop work good is to upgrade the RAM. Also the battery is too low. Power only lasts for 2.5 hours. This review is given after first time use. Also disk usage shows 10% in a brand new laptop.
1562,2,Very slow..if you open anything it takes lots of time to open...but other than that it's good...sound is very less..picture quality is nice.. although it's not up to the mark..next time if I buy laptop I'll definitely go for intel processor...AMD is worst
1563,5,Fabulous design with great keypad and touchpad
1564,2,"Very slow processing,less battery backup Don't go with this laptop if u want to do heavy tasking. It takes time to even open Google Chrome."
1565,1,Simply waste
1566,5,"This is best under budget and value for money , for better speed increase the RAM since it's only 4 gb"
1567,3,Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.
1568,5,Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources but chrome is a Ram- hungry devil ... Replace chrome with opera and install 8 gb of 2400 Mhz ram from crucial.....install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç
1569,3,"Ifter 5 days of use .... Taking time to boot up , performance is ok ok , rest all good ...."
1570,3,Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.
1571,4,"Good Entry Level laptop for everyday use. Just one suggestion, go for 8 gb Ram...or upgrade it later."
1572,4,Everything is fine. Note - need a ram (must) and ssd(optional) to work otherwise it's slow and also release heat.
1573,4,McAfee comes with 30 days subscription so I'm very sad
1574,5,Go for it.
1575,5,Good
1576,5,Nice
1577,4,Nice
1578,5,Osome product
1579,5,Nice
1580,4,Good laptop in this budget...
1581,5,Awesome
1582,1,"Value for Money, Pros: No heating problem, Low cost, Light weight, looks attractive, pre installed Office home student edition, 1 year unlimited device antivirus protection.  Cons: Slow, cant run heavy processes, no gamming please. Slow speed can be overcome to some extent by adding 8 GB Ram  re-rated to 1* Reason - Head phone jack loose connection is not covered under warranty plus service centre lacks staff who can fix it."
1583,3,Little bit slower but value for money
1584,4,Very nice performance. Should buy....üëåüèº
1585,2,It hangs anytime....and shut down.... processer is slow
1586,2,Slowüëé

1589,4,Camera is worst but laptop is best for all type of use
1590,3,Average performance. Poor battery charge. Good laptop for light work.
1591,5,Worth for price !
1592,2,Everything is good.. except its hanging problem... It hangs a lot... Sometimes its very irritating while working on it... I don't know what's wrong....
1593,5,Good
1594,5,Nice product
1595,3,It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives.. Battery backup is less Display is good It lags in between We have to increase the RAM for better performance No slot for LAN cable No USB slot in right of the laptop.. slots are in left side Cursor button pad is bit stiff.
1596,4,Best buy for this budget
1597,5,My use is only for drafting I use only ms office For me it's good.
1598,3,Ok product

1609,5,Good time delivery....
1610,1,"I bought this laptop after seeing its features and thought that it is a good laptop in a low budget. But that was my mistake. Bad things: sound is very low (speakers are not that good). The system is extremely slow, it takes a very long time to start. It started to hang within 1 month (even I didn't installed any other software or game in it). The speed of system is very very slow. Even to see photographs or to transfer files in other folders it takes a lot of time. Good things: FHD, design i..."

1621,3,Ok
1622,4,"BEWARE!!!: MS office is only trial version of 7 days. When you ask about this with seller, they directly initiate returning of laptop. Crazy way of customer support.  But the laptop is awesome. For the price it's awesome. I upgraded it with 4GB additional RAM and 3 years Kaspersky Antivirus. Now it's one rocking machine...  I actually bought 2 laptops . One for sis and another one for dad. Because i liked it so much."
1623,3,"Design is good , battery life also not bad approx 4 hours or max (on normal working ) , performance is not really speed but in this range good"

1649,2,"Sluggish performance, not at all good display. Poor sound quality and poor camera. Even if only Chrome is open, it would not be possible to open another application quickly. Not sure how come so many people rated it so high. It has only given me more stress than any delight of buying a new product.  Flipkart accepted to pick up the product and issue refund. I think they would have repacked and sold it to someone else and because of which the other person would have also gone through the same..."
1650,2,"I just use this product only 2 days. previously i used Hp intel pentium gold, since i used my old laptop 7 year's. and i feel more comfortable also have good battery back up. come to lenovo its take time to reboot the app's. also worst battery max 2.5- 3 yrs depend on works. also you cant use multi task at the time. come to processor compared to intel pentium gold, AMD ryzen not yet good. i suggesting in this budget you can get Hp brand laptop."

1661,2,Device speed is very slow not up to level doesn't worth for price
1662,1,Battery power is low...fan sound is high... don't buy this product
1663,3,It hangs a most while..better to get upgraded ram to 8 g or 12 gb then there could be some hike in performance..
1664,5,Much more better than Intel i3 processor Best budget laptop .......
1665,3,I hate it. Its performance is very slow. It takes too much time open Ms excel. Now think about about the other applications. Think before you purchase this laptop.
1666,2,PC is very slow. Brought based on review from you tube. All are fake a good laptop will cost more. I can't even use smoothy for Normal office work. Any applications take at least 10-15 seconds for opening.

1689,4,Fair product in this price range.
1690,1,Worst laptop I ever had...it's slower than a tortoise. Stupid thing takes 10 minutes to start and 15 minutes to shut. No laptop service station is understanding the problem and asking more money to improvise the hardware. Worst decision ever.

1692,1,Worst experience
1693,1,"Worthless laptop, never recommend anyone."
1694,1,"Never buy this product,this device kills your precious time"

1705,1,Laptop has slowed significantly
1706,1,It's so slow . Am just exhausted because of its speed. It will consume all your time to operate this laptop. It's slow as hell. Worst buying experience. Do not buy it . It can't open a word file. I atlast broke it .
1707,4,Product is upto the mark and for basic performance this laptop is perfect
1708,3,Good
1709,2,Worst laptop. Very slow performance.
1710,2,I purchased this laptop because of it's price but now I think it was a big mistake if you are reading this I request you not to purchase it. It is extremely slow and it's battery life is really bad. It gets irritating at time because it is too slow. And hang even while using a normal search engine. It would be better if you spend more 10000 and buy a better machine
1711,4,Very nice products
1712,5,"That's value for money......it's not a high performance machine but it's excellent in office,students,home usage,coding,light gameing,watching online content like Amazon prime videos,Netflix...ect.

I'm strongly recommend this product....lenovo is doing good work....üëçüëçüëçüëçüòä I'm happy for the product....üëçüëçüëç"
1713,1,Very very poor performance. Not even worth for 10k. At least i should have have buy good laptop with 10k worth in seconds which performs better. Very very disappointed with the product. I will not at all recommend this worst product. Please Don't go with rating and reviews. Check the performance lively before purchase it.
1714,3,"Iam using this laptop for about 9 months..... Firstly this laptop is not intended for heavy task , usually only for office works and media entertainment...This cannot be used for online class, because it have 0.2MP camera only... Don't use this as soon as booted , it take sometimes to gain its optimised state, It can't be used for multitasking, after windows 20h2 version battery about to be draining fast. If you are having experiencing crashes it is normal,, because 2.6gb of 4gb has been usi..."

1723,2,Battery is too poor
1724,5,After using 10 months i am giving review. Problem- 1.This laptop is good but if you work on multitasking its disk used 100% so you fill like hanging laptop. When you add m.2 SSD this problem will be solved. 2. Its (elan)touchpad driver is not fully integrated with this cpu so it not work fully smoothly.  And all things are good in this laptop.
1725,1,Excellent design Poor performance.. Dead slow Battery charge is nt satisfactory
1726,1,"Do not buy this product very bad not working very slow,if you want to buy this go to olx and purchase old desktop, that may be working good then this."

1729,3,It's in a very good price but the system is slow. It's not too slow but slow. Which makes it irritating while working..it takes some time to open some applications. Planning to add 4GB more d hope it works faster. Rest all good..display good..battery good..sound is low but is manageable if ur using for working purposes. Processor Goodwood at thus price

1756,3,I am writing this Review after using this product after 1 & half month. I purchased this product for my wife which she is currently using for her office work. Good thing about this laptop is it has good screen and performance is also good. Keyboard has number which is again a useful feature for working person. Only thing which flipkart promised & was not fulfilled was it will come with 1 year mcafee antivirus protection it got expired in one month.
1757,4,Best laptop under budget i am using more than 2 months I would suggest u to buy this under an average price

1762,3,"Does not come with McAfee antivirus 1 year subscription free as mentioned in product description but when raised a request by providing screenshots of product description which I took while placing order, Flipkart asked me to purchase McAfee 1yr license and then provide them with invoice which they then refunded to me in wallet, thanks Flipkart, awesome support. Tapping device is erratic, will need wireless mouse as soon you purchase this laptop. Will need to upgrade atleast 4GB extra DDR4 RA..."

1765,3,"Too slow, rest everything ok."
1766,1,"Extremely slow and pathetic laptop. It takes forever to start this laptop. I recorded the lag time for opening applications and was surprised to see how come a laptop be this slow in current times. My 1998 PC is faster than this junk. It takes 1 min 2 sec to open web browser, 38 seconds to open another tab in web browser. around 3 minutes to open zoom meeting and stabilize streaming of online meeting. This is when I have not installed any other application apart from whatever comes packaged ..."

1874,4,"Everything is good till now Battery could be better And The max briteness is not up to the need , it feels low when sunlight comes, could be 2 or 3 point more Else good One more complain why the hell price suddenly decreases from 30990 to 28990 after placing the order, it's unfair"
1875,2,Very Bed experience with processing and battery capacity.

1880,5,Some time it very slow working and battery Draining so fast but in this price it is a valuable laptop.
1881,1,Hanging problem
1882,3,Better to buy laptop with 8 gb ram. Display is good. Performance slow with 4 gb ram.
1883,1,"Lot of noise was coming from fan+cpu assembly of laptop. So I have returned it. Also had issues with battery, only 2.5 hrs time with battery. Heating issues were also there."
1884,4,Very slow
1885,1,Veru slow laptop dont buy it !!!!!
1886,3,Very slow
1887,3,Cheap and best. Home and Student purpose ok.
1888,4,It does its job and is a good budget laptop but do keep in mind that it is not meant for gaming and adding extra 8gb RAM (as i did) gives much more stable perfomance.... I got it for 25k for that price its absolutely great!
1889,3,It's getting fan sound heavy
1890,5,Nice product
1891,1,Worst performance
1892,4,Good.......
1893,4,Only problem is battery drain fastly. Otherwise best product. Worth buying at this price
1894,3,"This is a entry level budget laptop and even has a good performance due to the AMD processor, gaming might be twitchy while playing mediocre game but handles every day daily task easily but might be a bit slow while multitasking, overall it is not 5 star but a manageable lap for students and entry level laptop learners I would say"
1895,4,Display and built quality could have been better ... over All ok for that price ...
1896,5,It is good for free fire üî•üî•üî•
1897,1,Poor defect product

1900,2,Perfomance is so bad. I can't even use the mouse properly. Only the design is good
1901,3,Starting it was okay but as days passed its geeting slow. After opening application its doing good. But it lags while opening the application
1902,4,Good laptop for mid range users not good for gaming. But no lag.
1903,3,It is a 'kaam chalau' laptop. Bought it for my Dad. The only thing he doesn't like about it is its trackpad which feels weird and too plasticy so we use a external mouse.
1904,3,Battery down fast.. Works slow Hanging many times As per this drawbacks price is very high.dont buy.
1905,5,Using from 2 months no issue occurred till now. Processor are good for this price. If you want to use for your online classes then go for it
1906,1,Worst product.. Huge fan sound within one month. No proper support from flipkart.
1907,3,Dear team no body help me for system installation please help me
1908,5,"Very good Product and features also stylish design, Full HD display etc."
1909,3,Not that great. Expected better performance from the specifications of the laptop.
1910,3,Average performance.. Look and feel nice...
1911,4,This laptop is very good at this price range but if you'll need onsite support then I must say their customer support is terrible unless you live in a developed area.
1912,1,Very slow and the keyboard is bad and fan sound coming inside overall very bad product Totally irritated by buying this product
1913,5,"It is just fine for everyday use. Working nice and fast as expected. You can play 8k video also, battery drains when you give multiple task and play high resolution video, but it can give you atleast 3 hour battery backup. It has windows 10 Home single version upgradeable to most recent 20H2."
1914,4,Awesome project
1915,5,the laptop is good.Build quality is also good.battery is average and nicely fast charged.performance is good
1916,5,Best product
1917,3,Battery is Just about of 1.7 hours something . Just Useless Battery ...The upper case that is the Monitor Panel is too light that....It moves like ...There is wind blowing....Very Light ...But Overall to use this...U just need to Attach Power Cable everytime...
1918,2,Worst product
1919,1,Very slow and sluggish. Intel laptops are based. Finally sold it out
1920,5,display:4/5 battery:3/5 keyboard:4.5/5 performance:4/5

1922,5,One of the the best product on this price range
1923,4,"It's a Budget Laptop, never expect a Gr8 performance. But a very Student required Performance"
1924,1,Waste of Money
1925,5,THE LAPTOP IS VERY GOOD AND YOU BELIEVE ME BUYER'S IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO BUY A LAPTOP WITHIN A RANGE OF 30K TO 32K YOU CAN EASILY AND WITHOUT THINKING TWICE GO FOR IT.. IT IS VERY BETTER THAN i3 8th generation THANK YOU!!
1926,4,Slow but it's ok.

1930,1,Too much lag I can't use it daily basis waste of money I lost my money but I wanted to save your money so if your bray is in right place so don't buy it
1931,5,"1. Worth the money i spend. I have got in 24 k in big billion sale. 2. Plays 4K video flawlessly. You can imagine the processing power it has. 3. Designed beautifully, looks like it's made of metal body. 4. Adapter wire is short 5. Screen is bright enough and sharp due to 1080p resolution 6. Boot time 20 second, shutdown time 5 second. 7. Battery backup is 3 hrs with movie playing with highest brightness and full volume."
1932,2,"Very bad machine 25k ,,very hangedd +takingvtime to much ,"
1933,5,Not bad
1934,5,Price to Performance ratio is very good. Works like a charm for standard multitasking. Design is a big plus. Looks very elegant and classy. Weight balancing is also pretty good. Battery life is average 4-5 hours. Would suggest everyone to increase the ram to atleast 8GB. Better than Intel i3 7th gen that you might get in this price bracket. A great buy. Satisfied with the product.
1935,5,good one
1936,3,Fast delivery just in 31 days..... Nice product worth @. 25 k
1937,2,"Service post delivery after raising complaints was bad. Multiple follow ups and end result was nothing. Things take time to load even with a blank laptop. Screen part of the laptop has no stability, shakes a lot. You need to press hard on the mouse pad not the smoothest. If bought will need to be upgraded with better RAM."
1938,5,Superb product lenovo
1939,5,This laptop is not for heavy work.

1963,1,"Very bad laptop, very slow, hanging problem due to dicount offer i got in low budjet but go for i3"
1964,2,I thought it's good laptop but after one day it became very slow I think I need to add more ram and SSD to it in order to use it.
1965,5,Just expect to update the ram to atleast another 4 gb.. Laptop isn't so slow as its own.. But when there's a heavy load it will lag.. You can make this a beast if you can upgrage the ram and ssd.
1966,2,Laptop accha hai but battery is not good
1967,5,It is very useful and the best laptop ever.
1968,3,Not having CD disc drive. I am surprised that laptop is not having disc drive. Hanged once with in week
1969,5,All is well
1970,2,"Laptop is light weight and stylish in design. As per product description on detail page, it comes with lifetime MS office and free one year subscription of McAfee, but in reality the MS office applications are not getting updated and applications are not working as well as the subscription is only a 20 days trial and you have to purchase separate paid subscription of McAfee. Well the delivery system of the product is horrible and got my laptop after whopping 10 days....."
1971,5,Laptop is working fine no issues of heating or hanging while working face by me. Battery backup is good and it can work upto three hours without charge. Overall fine performance.

1976,4,nycc
1977,4,ASOOOM
1978,1,Not getting warranty card with laptop.and Flipkart not giviing any response for that really really very horrible experience of Flipkart
1979,4,Good product
1980,4,Product is good.. but a very delayed service from Flipkart.. would never trust on Flipkart again for any items as commitment to customer is on least priority for them.
1981,1,"Cost to feature good deal, but quite sometime lags in performance. So overall disappointed. The windows update even can't go smoothly installed on the laptop. very pathetic / poor performance."
1982,4,Nice
1983,3,One thing is annoying in this laptop is its fan noise.
1984,4,Overall good machine for basic work.  Using aroun 8-9 hours a days.  Battery -3-4 hrs average  Display 4/5  Performance 4/5
1985,5,Amazing product at this priceüòçüòç
1986,5,Dont hesitate before buying it.. True reviews- Battery backup is low If you want to use it heavy upgrade the ram and ssd The 4gb 1 tb varient is pathetic.. But if you upgrade it you will love the performance
1987,3,its overall performance of battery is very low with in one hr the 100% battery draining out very bad performance
1988,5,"Overall product is good. Good Picture quality, Good battery and good performance by processor. But build up quality is not so strong, quality of keypad is not so good, it should be improved. Flipkart customer support is very bad, they only provide assurance, not resolution. I does not get McAfee antivirus 12 month subscription. Today 15 days are going to end of delivery but still not getting Antivirus license key."
1989,5,"Value for money, I upgraded ram to 12 and its performance changed a lot, now i can play games like gta5"
1990,3,Speaker volume is very low as of my openion rest the laptop is good for basic uses....
1991,5,Nice
1992,5,Buy it....awesome product..ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
1993,3,"Over all ok, display quality is not good, performance is not bad."

1997,5,"Very nice laptop McAfee not for 12 month, it's just trail version so u can uninstall this, Ur laptop become fast if u paused automatic updates, and uninstall Lenovo pre-installed software and uninstall antivirus.   So all is good in this laptop  Laptop start time is 40 to 50 second"
1998,4,Finally satisfied with the product at this price....
1999,1,laptop is very slow in performance and it hangs while opening 2-3 tab in chrome...don't buy...
2000,1,This laptop gets heated and making too loud noise.
2001,5,Nice... For student.... At low budget... I purchased in big billion days at 25240
2002,1,Microphone not working...touchpad is loosely fitted...poor build quality...delay flipkart delivery...never buy anything from lenovo...build poorly and in huge amount so the price is so less but it will hardly last for 2 years...batter to go for Asus Vivobook 15 or any higher brands like Dell or hp...if you compromise with quality...you will regret later...spend some more money and go for other brands if you dont want your laptop last for only 1 or 2 years...
2003,3,"Non of the windows drives were up to date, had to upgrade everything and until it was upgarded, MS office wont get installed.  Lags a lot, better to get the RAM upgraded. Not for gamers or heavy users"
2004,5,Excellent product... Flipkart please make sure that the item is delivered on the committed time...
2005,4,"One of the best laptops in the market at 26k ,I think I can't get better deal at this price. But the performance of the laptop is average what we can expect in this prise range Other wise it is a complete killer"
2006,5,If you get a DDR4 2400mhz ram it will run fast as lightning and because of dual channel and 2 gb vram it runs games like GTA5 and almost all Big titles in gaming with descent fps on low settings .Check its benchmarks on youtube it runs almost all games descently.
2007,2,Very very very slow.
2008,5,Fully value for money purchase.
2009,5,Good deal
2010,4,"I got this laptop at 24240 Rs during sale time.  Design is very nice. Very slim and delicate. Display is full HD with matt finishing, but viewing angle is very poor because of TN display. I personally suggest for 14 inch display. Because in case of 15.6 inch display, screen is lightly swing/tilting with ceiling fan air. Performance is average, it justify price. Not so great. Battery backup is average, depend on usage, with internet it consume more power. Average 4 hour battery backup. But co..."

2017,5,"Good Looking,Good Performance,Average battery life.....Overall A Good Pacage at this Price Range for Students....Go for it :)"
2018,3,"Battery life less than 3 hours. Display isnt upto the mark. Lenevo 30gb promotion with Dropbox offer doesnt work. Better to upgrade RAM as onboard 4 gb will not help in even basic tasks, will always lag. Not for heavy use. Ok for basic programming and studies."

Screen size is big.. So overall product is good but as I mentioned don't go if you are looking for sturdy laptop."

2040,4,"Got it for 26 k on sale,best laptop for that price with a powerful Ryzen 3 processor"
2041,3,"The performance of this laptop SUCKS, really , truly sucks.  Dont buy this laptop for any more than 25k, so you can afford a ram upgrade & probably a ssd.  The display is above average. The battery is poor. The look is great.  Performance is worse than a pentium laptop."
2042,4,In ad it was written that Microsoft Office app is preloaded whereas I find that only Microsoft 365 is loaded for one year only. Rest all is fine so far.

2053,2,Bat
2054,4,Just bought this laptop.fully satisfied.worth every single penny.only one flaw is battery backup that is quite small.but charging is fast so no concerns. Do not purchase if you are a heavy gamer or want to do too many tasks.overall this laptop is good for students and professionals.go for it if your budget is around 25k to 27k
2055,4,"At this price point this one is very good The problem i faced is about speakers,the sound quality is very poor.better to but a sound bar or any small rated speakers"
2056,3,Good
2057,4,Great laptop for beginners. Might operate slowly due to low ram capacity. Windows 10 is also great
2058,3,"ok not so fast , speaker volume is less i dont where dolby digital has been used , no keyboard light display .very slow opening .opening three apps systems gets stuck."
2059,5,It's good... battery upto 5 hours....design super
2060,4,Everything is good except battery backup... hardly 3 to 4hrs while browsing and 2hrs when zoom call is on. Good thing is it was getting changed with in 1hr 30mins
2061,4,It is best laptop under 40000. If your budget is higher than 40000 then go for other laptops Everything is fine but yellowish didplay
2062,4,"For the price it's an amazing product. A little sluggish at times, perfect for casual usage."
2063,4,Nyc
2064,5,Awesome laptop..
2065,4,"This laptop is pretty good for the price tag it comes with. Got it for 23k in the big billion day sale. the only drawback was the 4 gb ram...these days even phones dont work well with 4 gb ram. i would suggest anyone buying this should also get additional 8 gb ram along with it to make this laptop amazing. The highlight is the design, thin bezels and display..i dont think any other company is giving these specifications in this price range. i am Pretty happy with the purchase as i bought adat..."
2066,5,I have bought it at 25k at that price it is best. Battery life i average when connected to WiFi. And sometimes it lags also.
2067,1,"Error status is shown as ""Hard Disk"" not installed. Disappointed with purchase"
2068,3,Built quality is poor
2069,4,"The RAM should be upgraded else the performance is very slow, after the upgrade it is good"
2070,5,Very good laptop of this price.
2071,4,"Laptop is awesome .. Best laptop under 30k Better go with Amd ryzen 3 instead if Intel core i3 8th gen, Laptop delivered after 8 days of book date ,it's OK bcoz purchased on big billions days , happy with this laptop"
2072,4,Wonderful laptop
2073,3,"Camera is ridiculously bad ..no clarity ..want to understand whether it's the issue with the laptop recieved or its universal with this model ... Keyboard acts funny ..they are actually interchanged so if u want @ u need to press shift and "" to get it instead of shift and 2. ..."
2074,4,"The laptop looked great however the build quality could have been better (plastic body). Got MSO student version with it and one month trial Anti virus. Battery is good but that depends how Im using my laptop. AMD ryzen is a powerful range of processors, let's see how it holds up in future. Digital Dolby sounds great. Fast charging almost takes 90min to full charge from 5%. Decent webcam. Keyboard looks great but without backlit so in dark look hard. But the design looks sweet and slim."
2075,2,After using it for a month now I can say it's too slow even in day to day tasks. I don't know with 4 gb of ram and 1 tb of hard disk how a laptop can work too slow. I also think AMD Ryzen 3 processor performance is not up to the mark it's too slow u must go with intel processors.
2076,5,"Superbb product ,ryzen 3 is better than i3"
2077,3,not bad at this price

2095,5,I m Fully Satisfied üî•‚ù§
2096,3,"performance average lit bit slow , display colors not natural and camera is very poor"
2097,5,I think it is best laptop for students.you will get 4 gb ram but you have to upgrade ram to 8 gb for better performance.Otherwise you will get poor performance.battery is about 3-3.5 hours.Display is very good.
2098,5,Very very very super laptop all is good.
2099,4,If u want it for daily purpose...it's the best in the Range. And if u want to do some heavy work..I would recommend upgrade the Ram to 8Gb
2100,5,It's very nice I loved the slim body of the laptop the function the keys every thing.its excellent gud product to buy and use it nodoubt
2101,4,Good
2102,5,It's a very good laptop at the price of under 25k Only thing is that the 4GB Ram is not sufficient for this because in 4GB model it is little bit lagging...Rest all things is good specially build quality and weight...ü§©ü§©ü§©
2103,1,The laptop is completely waste of money it's getting to late to open and hanging tooo much it is not the good product ..waste of money and waste of time .we never expect this from flipkart
2104,3,Very very slow and too lagging

2109,5,Value for money..... satisfied with the product
2110,2,Edited review.  Worst decision of my life buying this garbage. Utter waste
2111,4,"Hi,  It's been 4 months since I started using this laptop. I would like to say that it is a good beginners' device for basic functionality; no heating/hanging issues, tactile & responsive keyboard, good color saturation on the screen, charges fast and has moderate weight.  Overall, a good buy for the price."
2112,3,"Good design and light weight but performance is average because it's a budget laptop under 25k. Only for student or normal working or entertainment use, not suggest for multitasking or heavy use."
2113,4,Very nice product i love it .
2114,5,That's nice but performance will be batter after ram upgradation
2115,5,The display and build quality is damn good.Feels premium. Battery life is medium. 4.5 hours-5 hours on full charge. Processor speed is good enough. Ryzen 3 is better than i3 in terms of speed. Front camera is the only down side here.. its below average Overall it is awesome and probably best in the price range.. Theres a brand called Avita which offers higher specs like Ryzen 5 and 8gb ram in similiar price range but again its risky as its not a renowned brand and after sales service can be h...
2116,4,GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND OFFICE WORK
2117,3,"Build quality is good. Sound is very bad, lenevo should improve this. Display is ok. Battery backup is bad."
2118,3,A must buy laptop under 25k!!
2119,2,Slow perfamence
2120,5,Display screen is not that steady.Initially struggle to activate office. Overall good budget laptop
2121,1,"You cannot open 3apps simultaneously, for the same prize you can prefer avita ryzen 5 with 550gb add"
2122,1,It take ages to start .. nothing installed yet takes 20 min for bootup... Better buy some other brand
2123,3,"With 4 gb memory, we are not supposed to work on windows 10... too slow..."
2124,5,Good
2125,5,A nice handy product from Lenovo. Ryzen 3 is performing outstandingly. Sound quality is top class. Overall a fine product.
2126,4,Nice laptop with awesome build quality in this price point. Best buy if you are going to do just browsing and simple tasks on laptop.. Best value for money.
2127,2,Laptop get hanged in normal uses. Keep hanging at start and need reset of pc again and again
2128,5,Good
2129,1,Keyboard is not working
2130,5,Worth buy
2131,5,"Using this for 2.5 months now. Primarily to attend Online meetings, Online Classes, Email and working on documents. No complaints at all now. Affordable, looks good, works well. Hope the nice experience continues."
2132,1,System is very slow. It will take atleast 15 minutes to open. After that if you try to open a word document again it will take 30 mnts. Please don't go for this.

2138,1,Very pathetic performance.it gets hanged even if you is being played.not for multitasking. HD video is also seems as a normal standard video
2139,2,"Poor performance, battery backup is too low"
2140,4,Good budget laptop. I was sluggish initially... But was good after few configuration setting changes. The viewing angle of the display isn't good. It can be used for basic office work and online learning
2141,4,"This is the best laptop you can get at this price range, works well for all basic usage, softwares like Photoshop, Movavi Video Editor, etc. also works very smooth üòä"
2142,5,Nice productüòä
2143,5,I am using this laptop from 3 months... This is the best laptop in this price range... Best for your office work...No lagging (disable start up of affecting apps) For students it is perfect to learn and attend online classes... No buffering while playing Asphalt 8...  Just Go For It...
2144,4,Product is good but due some network settings fan started running continuously for 3 days then i went to reset network settings then it has been stopped.....
2145,1,display problem within 2 months

2152,2,"The Laptop was working fine eventually however later the battery life decrease drastically & the processor slowed down, now it feels like I clicked on n icon q century back & it just loaded the page."
2153,1,Don't even think of buying this if u do that u gonna waste Ur money... It take almost 10-15 minutes even to copy and paste a 30-40 mb file and u know what is even more frustrating that u even can't do anything else while it is copying bcoz it will hang if u try to do so.... Very slow laptop ...my old laptop that I got from gov. For free was better than this....won't buy it even if someone is selling it for 5000 only
2154,3,Good
2155,1,Its the worst laptop. Don't think I am a lenovo hater . Its problems 1. Battery backup is only 1 hour after fully charged 2. Don't even think of buying it for gaming . FPS is low and the laptop hangs . Even with 1gb graphic card and 4 gb ram it sucks
2156,5,Must buy. Excellent and is all rounder
2157,5,Most perfect
2158,4,Pros: ryzen3 is good @this price range : Good display : Premium looking design Cons: build quality is not that good : Touch pad is not so responsive : Hdd

2161,5,Nice just loved it.....
2162,3,Product very good but just sometime.lag this device.
2163,2,"I am writing this review after using this product more than a month. Processor is very slow, it's even hangs up if we work on more than 3 windows at the same time. To me I doubt that the company is actually installed RYZEN 3 processor, since it's seems to be working on some really old processor. Battery backup is also not very impressive all together is not the value for money at all."
2164,2,"Hangs alot. Performance is also very slow. It was having 10days replacement, but these 10days almost take for product installation and after thay when we start to qork gradually things comes up which become hell to even qork"
2165,3,Battery backup is not good
2166,1,"It has not even been a year, and the laptop is terribly slow, mouse has stopped working and one key kept auto typing until I disabled it with external software. I called the customer care, five days back, they haven't sent the engineer yet. My experience is not good with this device since beginning. I Do not recommend this laptop."
2167,1,Takes more than 10 minutes some times to open 1 excel file. Very slow processing
2168,2,Slow. Poor battery
2169,1,Worst things ever purchase Mother board note work after 1 month..
2170,3,Over all good product
2171,2,battery is poor only 1.5 to 2 hour backup not a multitasking laptop
2172,5,Best model under good price rate
2173,1,Very worst product Dont buy Fan sound is very high and both customer care are not responding
2174,1,Keyboard is not working after the use of 2 months...Also The Mouse Pad Is Not Working.... Attempted For Warray
2175,3,after using it for 2 months its pretty slow and worst sound quality
2176,1,"Please, fraud, defective Product, small size not order this product"
2177,2,Low audio and performance
2178,3,"This got a lot of complaints.. battery issues, fan issues.. getting switched off automatically while working. horrible buy.."
2179,4,very good product for student
2180,3,"OCT 2020- System crashed, got it fixed since under warranty. it was motherboard issue and they had to replace it. Now seriously doubt about the RYZEN processors. god knows how i am going to manage after warranty period.  September 2020 Slow system, bought for daughter online classes. Using for around 2 months now. Sometimes it freezes while in online classes."
2181,3,The Camera quality is too bad & the sound of the speaker is too low to listen. Didn't expect this type of quality from LENOVO. Do anyone has the way how to over this issue?  Picture quality is good.
2182,3,Very slow. We Need to upgrade Ram for better performance.
2183,4,If u use a wireless mouse and dont care much about battery life ... it is pretty decent notebook for the price. Suits my need absolutely fine. Have upgraded ram and installed SSD and its pretty quick.
2184,5,"This Laptop has been great so far. I got this for the MS Office offer and Windows that were free. I got this Laptop only for office use. Surprisingly, it runs games from 2012 quite well. Games like Assassin's Creed Black Flag and Batman: Arkham City run well on low settings. This is when I have not even upgraded my ram to 8gb dual channel which was recommended by many tech articles. I will get it later. Remains cool and does not heat up that much. Battery is not that good, but you can use th..."

2187,5,Very good üëçüëåüëå
2188,4,Good basic laptop for online schooling and regular MS office based Office working...
2189,1,Laptop went dead after 1 month due to keyboard shorting issue. Got it repaired under warranty.  2 months later the keyboard stopped again.
2190,1,"System works very slow, processor not support the regular work, it works toooo slow"
2191,4,Just ok
2192,4,Value for money laptop
2193,3,"Customer support very poor... If someone willing to buy, then put the money in some other use or buy it form nearly shop.. but do not take such product from flipkart.. My money totally lost.. And also lenovo support very poor and disappointing.."
2194,1,The brand new laptop is terribly slow.. there is lag for everything and I wish I can return the product.. not worth it
2195,3,"Ordered it and received ontime. Firstly very bad camera, those who use for online meeting, full grains u can see. Battery drains fast 2hrs max u can use. First 10 days return period it was silent but after that fan started making noise too much don't know any solution to it. Overall average to little above average performance for this price range."
2196,4,good laptop but battery drains faster not satisfied with battery backup it has overall performance is good except the battery backup.
2197,5,I loved it ? WFH People's Just go for it.‚ù§
2198,3,Good for online classes only ..if u try to open multiple tabs it just slows down..web cam and speaker quality really bad..
2199,2,My laptop speaker sound is turn so low. Dnt buy it.
2200,4,I feel little bit slow as hear about other person. Otherwise it is good for office work. Battery is also average not much atleast 2-3 hours giving backup. I will suggest all of u if u want to work day to day lifestyle just go for this laptop.. remember it carefully this laptop coming with plastic body..so plz use protection
2201,3,Sound speaker very worst pls design speaker in top of the laptop dont put sound speaker on down audio level very very low
2202,4,Good one
2203,5,Nice product according to budget
2204,3,Fan makes continuous noise which is irritating. Rest is just like any other laptop in this price range.
2205,4,Super
2206,3,I just think it's an average performing laptop. Maybe that's what you get for this price . ONE TIP use it on the LAP or a STAND if keep it on bed and use it for long it will over heat and start crashing until gets cool
2207,4,Fab oneüî•üî• but battery backup not so good except everything is litüî•üî•
2208,5,if you want for normal studying or office use then just go for it. It is pretty enough for daily task.
2209,5,Afterall a good laptop in this price segment.
2210,5,It's very good to this price.....I really thankful to flipkart üòäüòò.... it's very good experience with flipkart.... thank you...üíô
2211,5,"Seriously awwsm .. pls go for it without any hesitation.. the performance look wise so good budget friendly... Can be used for online class, online xms, browsing,and also for mid range games, basic level programming tally and all.. preferable to clg students"

2213,4,I am happy with this laptop. Good for basic use at home. Good for kid's use also. Battery is good - runs more than 4-5 hours. Not happy with Display and no caps lock and number log indicator light.
2214,5,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.
2215,4,"it's quite good ,and one important thing to do while updating win 10 or download win 10 don't turn up your laptop it's quite risky when you download your update quickly install and restart it and we are thinking about display quality it's good you can also play video upto 4K on youtube but first of all I think display quality is very poor cause of TFT panel but wrong TFT panel is also good but not like that IPS .  When you use it for office work then download WPS office it's good and featur..."
2216,5,"a god product for students, i'm writing this review after use of 1 month, if you use it only for online class and watching you tube then it's best for you & also its consumes less data if you setting in metered connection. so don't worry about data consumption.  pros- good battery back up & charging very fast, clear resolution screen and it's comes with a classy look  cons- a little bit slower, * It's takes 30-40 sec to open and after open it takes 3-5 sec to being ready to use and the ref..."

2218,3,"Writing this review after full 24 hours of putting this machine to grind. I bought this with a certain kind of apprehension, wondering the budget I had, the choice made after thorough research and the product chosen would cater to my needs or not? However, this piece of beauty is well equipped to go smoothly with my expectations of a big clear display, clear voice and word/pdf typing/reading works. A word of caution to the gamers though.. Don't go for this if you are into high end games. Othe..."
2219,1,Its my review after used after 5 months. Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes. Issues: 1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port. 2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs. 3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp. 4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work. 5. In sunlight one ...

2221,1,The webcam quality for video calls is very bad And it takes aloot of time to open each file or folder And the display quality is not good. For basic kids use only . only look wise its good Don't buy better add little more money and buy i3/i5
2222,5,Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social. For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting. Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop
2223,4,"Very Good in Display Quality. keyboard /Mouse Good. Processing is something , just something slow....but its good.. Over All I found this A Great Office work Laptop , so that i want. 5 mein se phir bi 4.5 dunga.."
2224,1,Overall below average laptop not worth buyin nothing noteworthy pretty much not worth the money Ps: not recommended to buy only if u can custom install and remove the stock parts
2225,5,Best laptop in given prize range..battery was gud but processor running slow..overall laptop was good for simple works
2226,4,"overall good... value for the price ...but not for heavy works .. it's ok for basic works like web browsing, emails, office works - excell, word etc."
2227,5,It's a decent product at a price of 20000. Does the job at the price point. Dont expect it to behave like i5 or i3. But overall good product
2228,5,1. Delivery was sooo fast.... Thanks a lot for that. Seller and Ekart.  2. Design- Good and weight also perfect for carrying.  Keypad color is not adjusted as per the product color. It is very problematic to use. No capslock indicator as well as numlock indicator. All USB ports are in one side.  3. Screen - Very good. It's carefully for eye. Very soft looking. Display quality is very good.  5. Performance- Good. Little bit slow to open excel those are greater than 1mb.  6. Battery - Not good...
2229,5,"Nice product for normal & jenuine home use only , and value for money. Proud on me for good choice"
2230,5,"Amazing product under this price range. It's stylish design, powerful processor and budget friendly is perfect for basic use. Really thankful to flipkart for delivering this amazing product on time."

2241,4,Full laptop is very good but slow üôÇ
2242,3,This is the best budget laptop.. I bought it for 18990 on a sale. Good laptop But performance is not as expected.
2243,3,Design best but no light numeric and caps lock On off. Performance is lower. Betry backup Average 3-4 hour. Display Good.
2244,5,Very good for normal work
2245,5,Good laptop
2246,5,Very nice üëå product net speed üëå osm prosesing normal looking *****
2247,1,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.
2248,5,Very nice laptop for study and design is very good with osm performance thank u flip kart
2249,5,Its best for general use like online study.Best at this price.Thanks Flipkart

2262,1,"Absolutely waste of money. Do not buy this laptop. It's so slow that you can literally miss whole class by the time it boots and connects. It cannot perform basic documentation even with minimal needs, you can finish 2 cups of tea by the time it is loading applications. Restarting this is absolutely headache and just keep seeing the circle in front. Sometimes it appears that there is no processor inside. Bought it for kids online class with basic functionality but my 'chintoo' threw on day on..."

2266,4,"Quality and Design is Super good, But the only drawback I found after using it for 2 hours is its battery performance.. Processing is some what lagging when I have started it for first time for setting up and installing some programs. Finally it is enough for that price range.."

2292,1,Late delivery of a crucial product ! Caps lock key doesn't even have a light to indicate if it's on unless we type and find it out! Neither invoice nor guarantee card provided. Slow performance and average battery life.

2305,1,"One of the worst laptop ever .Review after 25 days of use. Happens daily . Very slow at performance and requires 20 mins just to start up . On start up it nearly takes 15 mins for any application to open . Hangs continuously . Asus customer service support is also bad , they keep us on hold and never returns the call . Made the worst decision ever purchasing this laptop . Have to spend more to add accessories like RAM etc ."

2312,5,Thankyou flipcart
2313,1,Do not buy this..you will feel it is value for money but you do not get anything. The speed and performance is horrible. You cannot even open 2 tabs at a time. I tried to increase RAM but cannot do it as it has 4 GB inbuilt RAM and you can only add SSD which is costly. They lied that you can increase the RAM by 16 GB but you cannot
2314,1,Laptop is not turned on after 20 usage and waste of money. ASUS support team is too lazy and no response from them
2315,2,Not upto that i want and i think so much slow processor don't buy please if you have budget then only purchase another lap top don't purchase this one with low budget

2351,3,"Bought just three days ago. Looks okay. Light weight, good display, bigger keyboard buttons. 1TB hard disk in this price. overall great. However, If Asus can reduce the size which will look attractive, whole plastics is been used instead if they could have used metal, that would be essential. In India we all need low cost laptops for school or small business purpose. And a one more feature essential can make this laptop popular is the backlights in the keyboard.  No company pays attention to ..."

2989,4,Nice one with this budget
2990,1,1. Very slow. 2. Audio visual problem. 3. Key board is not visible if sitting properly. One will have to bend the neck and body to see keyboard.

3183,4,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image.

Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
3188,4,Awesome mobile smooth work fantastic I love this product my brother is so happy
3189,4,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
3190,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
3191,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
3192,5,Nice product in the price range and battery performance is too good ...camera quality is also good and speakers are so good ....love the device üòäüòä
3193,4,"The mobile is awesome. Had ordered it for my aunt. She was previously using Nokia feature mobile. This is her first smartphone. She is able to use is easily. Pros 1 Superb Battery 2 Good Display 3 Nice Connectivity  Cons 1 Camera is below average 2 The side mounted finger print sometimes don't recognize the finger 3 Mobile feels bigger in hand 4 Charging take almost 2 hrs  But for the price range, the mobile is good."
3194,3,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
3195,4,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
3196,5,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
3197,3,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
3198,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
3199,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
3200,3,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
3201,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
3202,5,"Excellent performance in every aspect but didn't felt the difference b/w 48m & other cameras, all click excellent pictures. The phone size is too big & you can't handle it with one hand. It's quite heavy. Looks stunning though"
3203,5,"Very Smart and Nice looking with Excellent technical specification 4 gb RAM and 64gb ROM, 6000 mAH better long battery work mobile 2 days.. As. Per price very Nice Mobile"
3204,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
3205,3,This Smart phone is very good phn.On gaming this is the best phn in few money..
3206,4,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
3207,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
3208,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
3209,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
3210,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
3211,5,Best Price This year best battery back up mobile Very fast delivery flipkart Stereo speakersüîä superb Full HD screen awesome.. Totally nice.. I like it
3212,3,Nice phone in correct price.. U should also try this phone Good quality of display and battery but something is missing like front flashlight
3213,4,.It has a good battery life . .Once fully charged if you are a normal user It will easily last for 1 and half day .Display is OK. It's not having much brightness when we put it on full brightness. .Because of 18 w fast charging it charges within 2 hr 15 min Front camera is not that much good. 48 MP main camera is good .I just used it for 1 week
3214,5,Nice mobile at this price point. Surprisingly it comes with IR blaster and the mobile is water proof and also have stereo speaker. Snapdragon 662 is a decent processor with decent gaming performance. Anyway uts a nice mobile at this price.
3215,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
3216,3,"WRITING A REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE Camera : IT IS OKAY TYPE BATTERY:ON NORMAL USE(6-7 hrs) it lasts about 1 day DISPLAY: NO PROBLEMS TILL NOW,So Far so good VALUE FOR MONEY:ü§îWorth it definitely üëçüèª  PERFORMANCE: GOOD,  IF PERFORMANCE IS A CRITERIA For you THEN YOU CAN GO FOR 6GB VARIANT(I HAD BOUGHT 4 64)  A GOOD IF YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR YOUR PARENTS,but go for 6 GB it is better in long term usage.Happy buying!  ALSO IN AN LITTLE BUDGET YOU CAN BUY REALME NARZO 30 4G(DO CHECK IT)üëçüèª"
3217,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
3218,4,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
3219,5,"Very fast delivery from Flipkart. Thanks. Redmi 9 Power has very powerful batteryüîã backup. Must buy, who want longer battery backup. Worth buy mobile in this price segment."
3220,5,"Just awesome, mind blowing purchase. Thanks a lot flipkart for wonder offers. Special thanks to e-kart because early morning 09:05a.m delivery my lovely products. Thanks a lot.

3221,5,"It's a decent phone I'm writing this review after the 2 days of use. Everything is good. When I ordered I was slightly concerned about the big branding at the back side but after putting the case on ( which was inside the box) it looks good and the branding doesn't feel like it's there. I don't play games so can't say much about gaming experience, but in regular uses this is really smooth. No ads till now. I think it is best at this price point."
3222,5,"Nice budget phone, camera is pretty good and battery is main attraction in this phone, display is very good. Totally a good phone under this price range"
3223,5,Very nice and photo clarity super battery power good
3224,5,"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone.

3225,3,Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.
3226,5,"Honest review after a month  Sound quality just amazing Display is really good at such price point Battery backup cames for a complete day even at heavy usage Gaming experience not upto the mark as I found many frame drops but you can play BGMI at low settings, always keep in mind it's not an gaming device Looks and design just steal the heart, wonderful  Under such price sigment  Overall for daily usage it's really amazing device"
3227,5,"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use."
3228,4,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."
3229,3,I'm satisfied with this mobile..actually i am first time using mi ui I'm fan of stok android but this is pretty good worth it
3230,4,It's a good phone for normal users.  I used redmi note 4 for last 4 years but redmi 9 power is not as fast as note 4.  After taking picture in camera preview pic is blur for one second then become clear image.  Battery is really fantastic  Camera is good in daylight and low light not so good.  Sound is loud enough.  Network signal strength is not good.
3231,5,Excellent mobile in this price. Battery backup is awesome. Camera is also performing pretty good. Good buy. Value for money. Loved it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
3232,5,"This phone is good for this budget. Phone back camera are quite good but front camera I give 6 out of 10. The process is great but battery backup are same as like 5000 mph. So, if your are 10k I will recommend this phone‚ù§Ô∏è"

3773,5,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage

3808,3,The battery performance is ok but phone is slow in performance and lag oftentimes.
3809,2,"I bought it one week ago and it has already started lagging. Sometimes it gets too much heated. Battery is good. There is a privacy issue. If you want to record someone's call, the phone let him know that you are recording. So it is very much problematic. There are lot of things that can't be done in this phone.  My only advice for them who wants to buy this phone is ""don't buy it. It's not worth it."""

4181,4,"Best phone under this budget, only Camera is not upto the mark. Battery is also good. Miui 12 on this phone could've been better, sometimes you will get to see some notification problem and the screen will black out and some softwares doesn't run so smoothly, display is good but other than that it's a fine phone. As for the Price please don't buy it for more than 11k the sellers are really greedy. I was lucky that I got it under 11k."

6698,2,Product is good. Only one major issue which is observed that it received very weak WiFi signal as compare to other smart phone. The WiFi signal fluctuates very often. VoWiFi calls also gets disconnected many times due to poor WiFi signal reception. The issue is with the model. This has been confirmed from the MI showroom. No one is going to give the replacement for this issue. :( So if you are planning to use it on WiFi maximum time then just go for other option.

6809,5,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
6810,3,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
6811,5,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
6812,4,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
6813,4,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
6814,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
6815,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
6816,4,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
6817,5,Super ... Duper camera very very Excellent handset I love Moto g30 . Low money products very happy products. I am proud of you this is a nice products.üòÉüòÉüòÉ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
6818,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
6819,3,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
6820,5,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
6821,2,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
6822,5,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
6823,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..
6824,5,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
6825,3,"Camera is goodüëçüèª not osmüòÆ , battery is poor according 5000mah‚òπ , display is osmm ü§©and selfie üëåüèª, stock android is osmmü§©. Bright ness is little bit .

6826,5,"Best üëç for who want a stock android phone lovers.., value for money üí∞ I love this one.., Everything is cool and clean I like the software. Best software experience and finest finishing The only thing I don't like is the phone felt like little weight.., And is it really 64megapixel üòÜ anyway Its a good stock android budget phone..,  Suggestion-- do not buy if u don't like stock android software..,"
6827,4,"A Budget Champ from Motorola. In first impression I've seen lots of new addition of customisation in stock android. New camera interface, UI customize tool, battery charging options, and lots more. My virdict are as follows Pros : 1. Nice 720P display 2. 5000 mah battery with 20w turbo adapter 3. 4/64 GB - 48 GB available for use 4. Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 - Adreno 610 5. Stock android with Android 11 out of the box Cons : 1. First ever in stock android I've seen companies software not ..."
6828,4,"Yes, the camera is not the best, the screen could have had some fine tuning, but the fact is, this is a no nonsense phone for the average Joe. I'm happy! Ratings: Design: 4 (The phone rarely looks like it does in the pictures above, more often than not, purple and even shades of green under inflorescent bulbs! But it's still classy.) Camera: 3 (It's there!) Performence: 4 (minor stutters occasionally, nothing worrying) Display: 3.5 (nothing a software update couldn't fix)) Ergonomics: 3 ( the..."
6829,5,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
6830,4,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.
6831,5,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
6832,5,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
6833,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
6834,4,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode. Also network speed is fine .I feel if need only call and browse as professionally, this is value for money. Did not try..."
6835,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."
6836,4,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"
6837,2,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...

6839,4,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
6840,4,First of all I really love Motorola This phone is really impressive with its design with its specifications its camera nd most powerful nd loved one is its pure stock android experience with moto customisation options there is no blootwere no adds no lags its pros nd now we discuss about its cons the review is true nd based on i m using various type of phone in this segment nd i also use motorola's many pjones   So the main nd major problem with motorola is hd+ display its really i feel if m...
6841,3,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."
6842,4,"Build quality 5  Display 5  Colors 3  Storage capacity 5  Performance 4 (Because phone becomes slightly slow while performing multiple functions)  Camera 4 (Because night clicks are not at all up to the mark, daylight shots are clean but you get best quality only in 64 pixel shots, normal clicks would have been better)  Battery 5 absolutely amazing.  Worth the price?10 stars....!! Definitely yes... Amazing phone you can get in this price compare to other brands.  If you are looking for be..."
6843,5,"I love moto phones by its gestures and it's more than average tough body than other smartphones. This time I purchased moto again because of its good quality plus fast charging and no bloatware (Bloatware is commercial software that is preinstalled on a device by the manufacturer, whether it's useful or not, and tends to waste memory and resources. While some of these apps may be useful, the majority of them simply sit there taking up storage space and in some cases, affecting the performance..."
6844,5,"Very good Phone for gifting to elders, because of super clean software with no spoofs, a very long lasting battery and super fast and responsive display. Excellent for doing everyday tasks. Not so good for performance tasks,or for camera folks"
6845,4,"It has 64 MP quad camera that's good it depends upon how you click picture,90 HZ frequency which is nice at this price point, 5000 mAh battery that's also nice, display size is also good, screen could have been more clear when you will see it from side picture will look black, if it would have been super amoled it would have been great experience, ram is 4 GB that is good but processors could have been little bit better, it has light sensor which will adjust your phone light according, face s..."
6846,4,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.
6847,2,"You can not get the phone flip cover easily, packings was wast even first time I have seen that ther was not bubbles rap on phone,looks like that packing was totally mess..phone performance is cute good however you will get the more Phone in less price.."
6848,5,"Superb battery life for office going persons and unique feature is that it gets charged up to 40-50 per cent in just 15-25 minutes. Camera quality is excellent only lag of focus white shooting videos. UI is pure no adds, no third party apps. Overall performance is good. I am writing this after using for more than 20 days."
6849,4,"Its a good phone for the price. Pros - 1- Excellent in hand feel and balanced weight distribution, phone feels so solid and amazing in hand!! 2- Display, even though 720p, still looks great and not pixelated and due to 90Hz it feels ultra smooth. 3- Loudspeaker is good, loud and clear, no distortion even at high volumes 4- Call quality is very good through earpiece and loudspeaker. 5- Performance is good. One ..."
6850,5,"One of the best budget smartphones available in the market. With the tough build quality and sleek design, this phone definitely stands out its competition. Camera is quite impressive for the price range, battery lasts for more than a day while data on, speakers are decent, performance wise- 4GB Ram and Snapdragon 662 work really well, however the display quality could have been better."
6851,3,"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger."
6852,5,Nice mobile Camera is up to average Battery is awesome Build quality is A1 a bit heavy but not so much Performance is good Display also good with 90 hz refresh rate Stock android experience is iout of this world All over a value for money phone in 11k I am happy to buy this phone
6853,3,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."
6854,4,Value for money. Gesture feature is fun. Hey Google works like a charm. Power button position accidentally turns of phone. Display & sound are good for what you paid. Camera is ok. Charging is fast. Go for it if want all rounder under 10k
6855,5,"Nice build, Doesn't bite your pocket, battery is okay, functional side good, touch screen looks wonderful like a feather touch. More than worth for payed"
6856,5,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
6857,5,"Everything is working all right, camera, UI, battery , fingerprint scanner is the fastest of all. The weight is evenly distributed over the entire phone it does not feel heavy at any specific point. This photo may not be clear but the real display is best with full colors."
6858,4,"G Non nonsense, decent product for the price, good built quality, value for money & obviously the stock Android experience is always the best with the Nokia or Motorola devices...would have been even better if Motorola had launched the 6-128gb version along with this"
6859,5,Everything is perfect except battery. I really love all the features. I recommend these phone to all. Battery Capacity is not good from my exceptation.
6860,1,"Simply worthless device ( My device at least) . Every time it gets a bit more load , it hangs and stops working. Above that I think it has some issues over wifi connectivity . All the other devices at my home work flawlessly with my router , apart from this one. In this device I get "" No Internet "" quite often while using wifi , while other devices are working fine . And there is no inbuilt app locker or something like that . My previous Redmi 5a with only 3 gb of ram was better than this."
6861,4,"I was looking for a mobile which has Stock Android 11 and not much choices ware available. I went for G30 for stock Android , big battery and Motorola brand. After 1 week of usage, Battery - 5/5 awesome, Performance - 4/5 , Value for Money - 4/5 as better processor are available at lower prices but it has Stock android. So far very happy with the mobile."
6862,5,"It is nice but expected a better performance, because motrola is a very good brand . But this is good phone so guys go for it."
6863,4,Hmm... Well it's good for less usage definitely not recommending to people who always stick on their phonesüçÅ best for mothers and grandparents kind of...
6864,5,Wonderful product of Motorola G30 very best quality and best performance really i am very happy to purchase this product fully satisfied in this prices Very very thank you so much flippant. Com online shopping companies are very best and bileeve for my next shopping programs
6865,5,"After a two months of use, it's totally value for money. Of course it's not a perfect gaming phone but it handles COD, BGMI etc., types of heavy games smoothly. For a multi tasking person it's a perfect budget hero. And the little touches of MOTO Experience apps gives you more satisfaction for it.  Camera: it's not a premium grade but it does fairly it's job.  Ram management is good.  Cons: Hybrid sim slot Display could be a bit better."
6866,4,"Camera and battery are good. Good charging speeds. Been using it for 3 months. camera can be made better with software upgrades (but it does the job). No bloatwares,clean UI, pure stock experience."
6867,5,"It's really an underrated phone maybe because of its display. Overall the stock android combined with Moto mods give a clean and friendly software experience. The cameras are really good,they provide true to nature colours. One of the most interesting feature is NFC though many people don't use it but it's really great to get it in this price range. The carrier aggregation 2*2 Mimo works pretty well and I get 4g+ at my place. The battery backup is really great I am able to get 9+ hrs of scree..."
6868,5,"Good buy infact best buy in this price range Built quality and user interface is too good as I have been using Moto ever since Moto G1 was in market Bought this as 1st mobile for my 7year old niece Very user friendly, rugged and well built"
6869,5,"Great value for money product. Decent camera. Good display, Good performance ance for standard usage. Great battery life. Stock android experience. Overall good smartphone for the price point."
6870,4,"Flipkart delivered in time and good packing. Moto G30 Mobile Good performance, Camera quality good, Nice Interface, Compact Display. Overall performance and working is good and Best Budget mobile on its price."
6871,4,Bought motorola g30 for my mom. And phone is really good. Has big screen. Sleek and easy to carry. Has facial lock feature which works good. Is a good purchase within the range of 10-11k.
6872,5,"Excellent device at this price. I bought this as my secondary phone mostly to netflix and other stuffs. Battery backup on screen time is 12+ hours on a full charge which is amazing. Camera is good, not the best but works Excellent with Google camera so you can download from xforum. Display is kinda less bright even on it's full brightness as compared to other phones but for me it's not an issue because i mostly stay indoors with this device. Performance is good, it handles multiple apps simul..."
6873,5,Thank you üôè Flipkart for delivering the product sooo soon..... Mobile is osm with great battery and performance Camera is Average not the best....... Stock Android is so smooth and clean no lang or so.......
6874,5,"SD 662 is decent processor for day to day work, work very well. No issues while operating mobile phone. Build quality is also very nice. Two major issues, 1. Camera: No use of 64MP, it only take 16MP pics and that too processing is too slow, if you take any picture, it take almost 10 to 15 seconds to process that pic, than only we can see pic if that is correct or have to click again. Motorola need to work on processing speed otherwise it's just waste of money. 2. Brightness: Very week. Bt ..."
6875,5,"Motorola phones are underrated perhaps because they do not do publicity like few trending brands in the market. The UI is clean free of bloatware so less background process running increasing battery life and speed. RAM management is excellen, moto shortcuts are excellent and very very hand. Build quality is good. I have few other moto phones running without any issue after even 4 years of rough use. The camera is average and could be improved. They don't tune much and pictures are quite natu..."
6876,5,"I am writing this review after a month of using the mobile. I was previously using Moto e4 and hence o upgraded to g30 of same brand. The features have been very good. The camera clarity and the video clarity has been excellent. Cost fitted my budget well. Has additional features like screen recording, call recording among others. I am very happy with the mobile and as well the delivery service by Flipkart!!"
6877,5,Its a decent phone for everyday use and performs well for normal usage and i feel the battery backup is pretty impressive as i gifted this to my dad who is pretty happy with it and due to close stock android no ads or malware are bugging my dad so it is pretty neat and user friendly i can say.
6878,3,"Recommended only for those who are love stock android experience. G30's camera and screen resolution üëéüëéüëé My 1st aim to buy these phone for stock android experience. If you want best camera and best screen resolution G30 is not for you. My old great phone is lenovo k6 power use about 4 year and that's brilliant camera,full hd,lot of features and Extra ordinary battry life but sadly He is no moreüò£üò£ i miss that phone. My old phone perform best camera output than G30."
6879,4,It's good product by Motorola i am preferring this by using MOTO G TURBO ..NOW THIS IS ALSO very good mobile and price Worthy.thanks Motorola..For introducing..Such product
6880,5,"Nice camera setup üëç . It's not a Chinese phone , performance good at this price point , battery life good , support fast charging ,very decently placed notification light . Wrist twist camera open gesture , metal gril placement in speaker on top.vaule for money phone strong build quality"
6881,5,"I am proud to mention that I own Moto G30 and chose the same over nord. What I like - It's compact.  Display is not the best like you get in flagship phones but yeah considering the price point it is definitely at par with the devices in this range.  Processor is more than enough if you're not a pro gamer and every other task feels so smooth. Infact the entire device feels fast in daily normal usage.  Google has taken care of every small detail like haptics, microphone, speakers minimalistic ..."
6882,5,The most attractive part of this phone is its battery backup..nice premium quality photos and interesting features in it..overall loved the phone and would say its too good and evry penny spent on it is worth it
6883,5,"This new phone looks great , main advantage is bloatware free software and battery backup.Its now running on android 11 out of the box.It really gives 48gb free space for you out of 64 gb after installing OS.In 11,000 price range with all other features is good value.Make sure to use back cover and tempered glass when using this phone,it will work great after this. Disadvantage is hybrid sim slot."
6884,2,"I am using Motorola phones since 2014, during this 7 year I used 5-6 different model of Motorola phones, my experience was very good.

6918,2,"I'm using this mobile for last 1 month. Few drawbacks encountered: 1. Worst battery performance. Previously I was using MotoG5s+ which had almost a complete day battery power even after 3 yrs of use, but this device hardly survive for 12hrs. 2. Slow charging. Since Motorola is providing Turbocharger, but I don't know why it takes about 4 hrs to charge fully, and discharge within 7-10 hrs. 3. Camera quality. So many functions are there for camera, but they are useless if resolution and dpi is ..."

6956,1,"Camera quality is okay but pics/vids occupy more space than expected as per the quality of photos.It provides no gallery of its own that's very annoying.Overall phone is less customisable. 64GB for 11k is really expensive, out of which only 48Gb is usable, it isn't Value for Money tbh."
6957,5,Very beautiful phon & good camera I like it
6958,5,Motorola is my all-time favourite Mobile brand. So the name is enough for me. This two photos captured with my Motorola one fusion+.
6959,5,Best phone in best price

6976,4,Good phone for this price
6977,4,"Performance is good. Battery lasts for 30hrs for an average usage on 4g. Camera quality is average , you need to edit settings for better picture. In colour shots is working. Almost using 100+ apps on it . Touch & screen quality is best. Hybrid sim slots but am using two sims instead of MMC card. Finger print sensor is a quick. Face unlock is a bit slow. Have played games without a lag ...I have ordered dark pearl 64 gb ."
6978,4,Awesome phone.. Thanks Flipkart
6979,4,"Overall great phone. But, even the Dark Pearl color is a lot light shade. It looks more like silver under bright light."
6980,5,Fantastic phone with amazing features at reasonable price
6981,4,Good for the price. Stock android experience Camera 2/5
6982,1,Was expecting a better product considering Motorola as a brand ..  Camera is worse ... Video playing experience is bad too.  20 watt charging takes 2.5 to 3 hrs to full
6983,1,"Until now I used Moto G (Firsts Generation) for almost 7 years now and it still works like a charm.. but to upgrade I bought this new Moto G30 thinking it is going to be far better than its predecessors, but it's the worst phone ever by motorola. It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot. It overheats quickly and even though it has a 5000MAh battery it doesn't last that long. I'm very very disappointe..."
6984,5,Good Delivery Service.
6985,5,I just love everything about this phone Every thing on it it's super....!!
6986,5,Good mobile.
6987,5,"I am editing this review after 6months of usage.  At the first everything worked perfectly, but now I am facing slight lagging in camera.When I opened camera it is taking ~30 seconds to open & sometimes I have to click 4-5 times to capture photos. But quality of the photos is really good( find attached the photos)  And front camera wont have zoom option.  Apart from this everything works perfectly."
6988,1,"Hybrid slot, not good compare to other phones. Camera also not good. Hanging problem"
6989,5,Very best quality
6990,1,The camera is bad. It's tooo bad that I will never buy a motorola mobile again.
6991,1,"Very Weak, a simple fall from 1feet broke the screen and became unusable. Other cons about this useless phone is - it feels heavy. Charging is very slow(even 33w) and dis-charing is very very fast. Please don't waste your money on this stupid phone. Only good thing about the phone is its camera and stock android. And since moto is the only phone with stock android, had to purchase."
6992,5,This phone is very good
6993,1,Very bad battery backup... Hang problem...
6994,3,Over-all nice performance with stock android. SATISFIED ü§ó
6995,4,Best quality products
6996,5,"Does the job.  Pros: Battery. Large display. Android version.  Cons: Llittle lag while using multiple apps at a time. Camera is not up to the mark but fine for this price. Display is not HD+, for this price they can at least provide HD+ display.  Final verdict: Good mobile packed with everything for a reasonable price."
6997,5,very nice product
6998,4,"Phones overall performance is good at this price segment, but their camera performance in like 24 mega pixel .."
6999,1,Not good this phone battery is not good

7018,5,"Cemera is definitely good, display could have been full hd, but is good & battery lasts 1 day for me( uses internet a lot, especially YouTube & OTT platforms). For this price its value for money."
7019,5,For the amount‚Ä¶its a killer phone‚Ä¶if you have kids at home and need a phone for their online class and other activities‚Ä¶go for it‚Ä¶!!!
7020,5,The phone looks awesome. The stock android gives clear UI to experience. Loved the way Motorola competing against the Chinese brands.
7021,4,Overall Good phone
7022,5,This is brought for my husband and he likes it too much thank motto
7023,4,The phone is great but there are software bugs & issues which needed to be fixed by upcoming system updates by Motorola. The software cons are:- 1. Dialer slows down during incoming calls & sometimes freezes. 2. The camera needs improvement in night shots. 3. Android 11 drains battery much more than android 10 so this issue need to be solved by Google inc. 4. Google assistant button needs customisation like quick camera or quick dialer because one needs camera or dialer in emergency & not go...
7024,2,Worst build quality ever. Didn't expect this from Motorola! I've broken my display within a month. I've redmi note 9 & moto g 30. Both fell down from my hand accidentally and the irony is note 9 doesn't have any case or glass but it survived. But moto has both glass & case still the display was shattered.  It hangs a loooot. Like a looot.  Camera can be manageable by using G cam  Sound is decent in this price range.  90HZ Lags  No protection at all.  Battery backup is good.  If you are...
7025,2,"The display is not up to the mark, and the camera is not at all good."
7026,3,Better phone üëå
7027,5,"I think this is by far the best phone out there in this price range only because of its clean and near stock user interface. No bloatware, No BS. Just plain stock experience."
7028,5,This is my 6th moto phone in last 11 years. Still the same quality.
7029,5,Camera quality ok
7030,5,Overall Good phone in this price segment.
7031,5,Nice Phone but camera quality is not too good
7032,3,Camera is 64mp but its not good .clearity of camera was disappointed... Not upto the mark and picture clearity is not good. Worst camera clearity and features.
7033,5,It's really a great purchase üòåüòå

7040,1,Not happy with camera while using whatsapp. Kindly refund my money Not happy with Flipkart

7044,5,Good camera
7045,5,Value for money
7046,2,"Worst Battery. Didn't even used the phone, but the battery drains like crazy. Really disappointed."
7047,3,Phone is a bit heavy also I had to pull off the screen guard as it was a printed one. I had to buy another proper screen guard.
7048,5,Super
7049,4,Battery capacity low and camera üì∑ average Nice looking attractive üòòüòòüòò
7050,3,All things are awesom But camera is 64 mp it's just number not actull 64 mp like 24 or 32 mp . And other perfomence is awesom
7051,5,"very good performance ,and ghank you flipkart"
7052,4,Very nice
7053,3,Takes 3 hr to get fully charged. Battery drains a bit faster. Camera is bad in low light. Go for another options with this price range.
7054,4,Value for money
7055,1,Waste of money
7056,4,Very nice mobile i love it moto
7057,4,While charging it's having heat issues.
7058,5,"Stock android experience , worth the money"
7059,5,Overall worth.
7060,5,Good product compared to it's price. I think this is the first device to have advanced security(Think shield) for budget device. SAMSUNG provides knox security only for premium device
7061,5,Very good mobile! When I bought this phone gpay QR code does not work now the problem is solved by Motorola updated thank you Motorola network speed is little slow may be because of processor hope this will also solve soon I love the phone 'cause the name is MOTOROLA!
7062,5,"One of the best quality mobile at reasonable price. It is definitely better than MI, VIVO, REALME & OPPO"
7063,5,Best in this range for social use If u want to play heavy games then u add more 2 to 3 k u can go for better options
7064,5,Camera performance is not as per aspectation and left all thing is perfectly fine.

7066,3,Screen should have been Full HD. That's only a drag down.
7067,5,Nice mobile
7068,5,Nice product
7069,1,It was the worst camera set up and performance that I could expect from a mobile they mentioned it to be 64 mp but when compared it's own previous model of moto g5s it has worst cameras ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è my piece of advice would be just move away from this mobile ü§ó good day
7070,4,I find this one of the best phone in this Category.... Specifications are really impressive specially the battery and the Processor along with good interface....üëç

7078,2,I am not satisfied this product
7079,1,I've been using Moto phones since first Moto-G generation and I must say that all the phones have done justice to their price. But this phone is really slow and has lag which is not a trait of moto phones .The worst thing about this phone is its battery life.
7080,2,Sound quality is not good..nd camera is not performing well..
7081,1,"Camera quality and screen touch is so bad, battery backup is poor I am so disappointed from this"
7082,5,Don't trust the old negative reviews. I am using this phone for past 2 weeks it's really awesome
7083,1,Very worst product and flipkart services or camera quality and build quality is very bad
7084,5,It's really nice..the colour is classy. Value for money and even really work smoothly and the camera is good but cant even expect much in such rate...if you are still confuse I suggest you might go with it as the phone all over is awesome.
7085,3,Network quality very bad
7086,3,Value for Money
7087,5,"Highly recommended handset , working well with recent updates , my wife live this"
7088,4,Lock button & phone speed performance having problem...seems phone hang even with low number app's...Poor performance Not as expected
7089,1,"Poor network, touch not working properly. Return policy"
7090,3,"Battery drains quickly being a 5000MAH it has to have atleast 24 hours of battery life but it gets drained everyday and you have to charge it for every 12 hours, Camera is good, Display is average, Heating issue when browsing (Facebook, WhatsApp or other social networking apps) & YouTube etc. It comes with a 20 Watts fast charger for a name sake only. You cannot apply a theme to it but you customize apps appearance, apply colors & various text formats or styles. This is one of the average pho..."
7091,1,"Wifi connectivity is bad, continuously disconnects even after resetting the phone and network settings same problem, very unstable. Had to return and get a replacement but the replacement phone has the same problem. Guess this is a problem with this model. Don't even think of buying this phone. Motorola has lost its value. I regret getting this phone. Also don't ever trust YouTube reviews. I trusted them and now am suffering. Total waste of money."
7092,3,"Camera quality is very poor I'm using Samsung M30s @48mp which is far better than this, u can opt this mobile if camera isn't an option for you, performance wise this phone rocks.."

7103,1,"Mobile hanging, while Gpay barcode scanner unable to scan again hang, after taking image, while image open again hang, sound on full volume became broken speaker like sound come, one Sim and one memory card or 2 Sim at a time, camera image size around 4-5mb by which stores more space on mobile memory. selfy camera image quality not good"
7104,1,Worst phone. Don't by this product. Camera is not good even it is 64MP. In browsing there is no back button at all. We need to install the Assitive touch.why we need to install? Poor quality in calls. Suddenly it will disconnect the call.
7105,1,seroius issue with upi system just go for any other alternative
7106,5,I used only Motorola mobile for last 17 years. I purchased 7-8 Moto mobiles till now. best product. camera is best. battery back up is also good. best product in this price .
7107,1,Very bad performance app shut on its own i complained but no response from company very bad services
7108,1,Not fantastied with the camera quality.. yepp battery backup is nice.. But we purchased this phone just for camera quality.. Over all This product is not that good as expected..
7109,1,"Product is very bad. Don't buy this item Hanging problem bad camera quality,,üëéüëéüëé"
7110,3,"Looking very cheap. Camera also not so good. My Mi A2 is better in terms of looks, performance and camera except battery."
7111,2,It's too heavy and big size like Power Bank think 2 times before buy
7112,1,Only camera and battery is good and all performance is not good
7113,1,Display is not 90Hz. Switch on the developer mode and there you'll find out. That's a sure lie. Camera is of low quality. Can't capture with detailing. Weight of the device is too much.
7114,1,Display worst better Don't buy this
7115,1,"Waste of money to take Motorola G30. front camera is not good , touch screen is not good.  Instead of Moto g30 take Moto g 5 plus."
7116,3,"Overall at this price, everything thing is balanced. It is better if it comes with Full HD Bulky, thick useless bezel at bottom. Slow charging, should come at at least 30W or more power charger. Given 5 star because at this price we can't compare with 20k segment. Expect timely security updates and Android update fron android.  One line for Flipkart: product reached 4 days before to nearest hub, but they deliver on last day doesn't make sense"
7117,5,Nice
7118,5,Very good quality and very good Flipkart Service for Dilivery in two days
7119,5,Overall performance is not good and mike isn't working properly
7120,5,Osm phone
7121,2,Face lock quality is very poor Battery performance is also average not as a 5000 mAh battery work's
7122,3,Charging time is 0 To 100% is 3.30min it's not a fast charging. Please develop this option in this product
7123,4,It is a good budget phone which can be used for daily purposes such as calling & Social Media. Battery is good which will give you a whole day power with single charge...  Preferred for students for online class purposes only...  This phone does support gaming but there are heating issues and some lags while playing Huge games such as COD....
7124,5,"Received the phone in exchange of old phone. Moto is a super phone especially for senior citizens. Durable for years.. Good buy under 12k. Smooth premium look..

The HD+ IPS display is bright with good color reproduction and brightness. 90 Hz refresh rate is an added advantage. Camera is not that great but good. The processor is capable of 4K video record...

7467,5,Review after using for 3 months:  Pros: 1. Definitely lives up to motorola's legacy of solid build quality 2. Awesome performance without any overheating (1 hour of BGMI makes it heat slightly but not overheat) 3. Superb battery life (consumed only 3% battery on playing BGMI for 30m) 4. Fast charges from 0 to 60 in about 20m (which lasts a whole day of heavy use) 5. Motorola features and gestures are bonus  Cons: 1.

8187,1,This phone is weird. Battery life is ok for one month only then it gets worse. Screen brightness is low compared to AMOLED screens. DO NOT buy it for gaming because the performance is poor and also the google assistant button gets in the way. If you turn the phone then the speaker gets covered and I think its the biggest blunder in this phone by Motorola. I have owned more than 10 Motorola phones and I think this one is the worst.
8188,1,"Diled or receive mob. no. automatically change in unusual no like 888888, 3059. 3060"

8842,5,I purchased Mivi earphone.since from purchased a problem continues that in running music disconnected after every 30-40 sec. and I have done a mail complaint regarding it but not solutions yet and no any answered by you.
8843,5,Bad earphone after 2month of use one side isnot working
8844,1,Super made in India
8845,5,Mivi is no.1 India company. I was using mivi products since launches. All the products is top quality.
8846,1,Flikart Service & products are bad. Think again before you buy the product
8847,5,Completely waste of money... Worst product ever seen.. Do not order. 1. Sound quality very poor. 2. Volume is low 3. Connectivity issues frequently gets disconnected . 4. Build quality is bad.. cant use it for long. üëéüò°
8848,1,"Waste of money, given 2 star because it's Indian company and product. Battery backup is almost nil. Connects and disconnects automatically. Very much irritating during calls. Not comfortable for every day use. Company should not have compromised on quality because of few hundreds"

8852,5,I have used it from the day i haven't found any glitch in this neckband. Honestly its sound quality very clear and bass quality is super awesome. Also it gets charge in 40 mins when i connect it with my 18watt charger adapter and have good playtime last survive upto 8 to 9 hours on single charge
8853,1,Please don't buy this product.this product is very bad
8854,1,One of the best neckband you can buy for under 1000 Advantages -One of the best battery backup for a neckband -Good sound quality for the price -Build quality is also good -Descent bass -Seamless connection -Worth it  Disadvantage -A bit loose(maybe just for me)   Worth the money

The main reason why I am appraising them with only 3 rating is that if anything is faulty in your products you can't reach service center through call and you can only mail them about your complaint.

One star reduced for battery backup because it stayed upto 6hr only in active state after 30min full charged and other star for mic quality as other are hearing voice at low level, I don't know whether is it problem with mic or standard far distance of mic from mouth.

11996,1,"Great camera!!! Took some time to understand all the basics of photography... Its giving good quality pictures. I shoot raw, and post processing the images are coming really well. Autofocus is nice and 5fps is working well for me... 300mm lens is OK... need to get another one since i mostly do birds.. need more zoom üòä Overall its a great camera for beginners!!!!"
11997,3,"Best Mid range camera for photography lovers. I am writing the review after 3 months of using this cam , this is my 1st DSLR canon is a user friendly cam, it is basically good for videography. Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses"
11998,5,If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.
11999,3,"Excellent camera for beginner photographers and also a best back up for pro also. Amazing colour depth, fast focusing, crystal clear photo. Lightweight is a advantage while you are travelling. Vary angle screen is very useful when taking ground level shots or over the crowd shots and very helpful for blogging purpuse also. You can attach external mic. Battery life is very good. Through WiFi and snapbridge downloading photos in smartphone from camera is too easy. It supports Bluetooth also. I..."
12000,4,"You can't have a better mid-range DSLR. However I don't like 18mm-55mm lens, but you'll get sharp and crisp photos with 70mm-300mm lens. The camera is feature loaded and very light. You'll love it."
12001,3,"I think this the best entry level dslr in this range. I got a 18-55mm kit lense, 16gb memory card and lowepro bag. Bag quality is good. This model is good because you are getting a touch screen enabled dslr in the price range where most of other brands giving non touch screen models. Some features like very easy to operate, touch screen, fast auto focus and sharp images make this dslr a best entry level dslr. I am attaching some pictures clicked with this dslr(flipkart not letting me add more..."
12002,5,"Wow, love the Camera....I have already used Nikon d 3500 in my Laboratory but this camera is far better. Flipkart delivered at time and the product was at best conditions. This is my first personal DSLR, so guys after using for 2 weeks, I must say that go for it, there is no other camera which could provide same level as Nikon d 5600. Colour tone production, lots of effect, smooth touch screen, good battery life, etc. Just go for it."
12003,5,No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...
12004,5,"My First DSLR and the best decision that I made. The KIT lenses are not so ideal for lowlight photography but you can always get the best out of it. Overall very satisfied with the quality of photos, camera body and lens to start the learning process."
12005,5,"Excellent wow, what a camera! value for money, must buy. best entry lebel camera. flipkart delivery is so fast. very good packaging. no 1 genuine product."
12006,5,"Best DSLR üì∏ on this range üí∞, I think nikon provide best product in DSLR. Picture was so good I just love with this DSLR"
12007,5,Good semi professional dslr from Nikon. Packing is good and the product is really nice. Not recommended for professional photographers and good for a beginner. It's features are best in class and have a good quality material in real. It's touch function is lit. Rotating screen helps in taking photos or record videos in selfie mode or in certain positions. The bag which is packed with the camera will only have the space to adjust lesser items. For a professional photographer it is recommended ...
12008,5,Very Fast Delivery by Flipkart nd Service! I like it! Nikon D5600 Is Super Camera In this Price Range! I Really Happy With My New Nikon D5600 DSLR! It's Amazing Cemera! Picture nd Video Shooting is Superb! If You Are Search Entry Leval Camera!? In This Morden Life!? So it's A best Option For You! I Really Love it this Product! üëçüëå

12010,5,Best DSLR for beginners..don't think too much just click buy now..!I purchased on bbday with a great deal but i bought single lens. So i suggest please if you want more depth or wildlife photography then go for 70-300 mm also. Even though it can deliver good photos with this 18-55 mm lens. Thanks to Flipkart for the great package and delivery. Happy click..!
12011,5,Reviewing after using for an year. This is my first dslr and It gives stunning images. The 70-300 lens is simply awesome and thats the one I use the most. Autofocus while taking video is really bad. It cant focus well on moving objects. Even for slowly moving subjects it doesn't focus well. I think Canon200d is good if you prefer videography as it has much faster autofocus although the price is much higher than Nikon D5600 .But if your preference is only photography then go for it as it is a...
12012,5,"Cant say anything about the DSLR right now cause I am learning how to shoot but flipkart delivered it in a safe packaging and on time..  Edited on 16 Jan 2020 So, now I am using this for last 6 months and I want to say best in this price. I am not highlighting the features which all dslr have. but the best features which you will get in this price which none other dslr can give you today are 1. Articulated Touch screen. 2. Wifi transfer. 3. 39 AF point  Just go for it. Its a big plus. check o..."
12013,5,The camera is excellent. Probably the best one in this price range. Completely happy with the camera.  Would like to mention that the bag I received is a good quality Nikon original bag.  Giving 4 stars because it took 14 days to get the product delivered despite of having a Flipkart plus membership.
12014,4,"This is one step above the Entry level ( Nikon D3*** series). Pro - Light weight , Easy to handle , wifi , articulated screen . Image Quality is good . Low light performance is good . Better than expected. Snapbridge for your easy file tranfer Can shoot Raw + Jpeg Best in Mid level DSLR I had got a ridiculous deal with 18-55 and 70-300 deal. Thanks to Flipkart.  Cons - insufficient grip . Those who are new to DSLR won't find this . But the ones who are trying to upgrade this will disappoi..."
12015,5,"It was delivered in good condition. When it comes to camera, it is really good and easy to use. Good choice for a beginner."
12016,5,Awesome product but came with worst packaging. The seal of the packaging box was open. Flipkart should show some effort in packing camera like they do in mobiles. About the camera I would say that it's one of the best dslr in its class. But flipkart providing only 8gb card instead of 16gb. Rest the product is all good. Happy imaging.
12017,5,iam surprised. great dslr at this price range.. better to handle.. user friendly cam.. low light picsüí• .. really loved it !!
12018,4,"Great APSC DX camera which stand besides the Big brother D7100 & D7200. Instead of thease it have a Articulated Screen with Touch function, its a great option for those looking Midranged entry leval DSLR. U can also check D5500 & D5300. overall its a great deal. If u dont mind about your pocket then u can choose D7100 or D7200."
12019,5,pros : Beginner level camera bast for YouTube purpose focusing is fast in photo only build quality is amazing effects extra feature is best for quick retouching zooming and Focusing very perfect inbuilt mic plus sound battery backup amazing  cons : Difficult to learn User interface Bag quality is worst low performance in videography only 16Gb memory card provided  overall best
12020,4,It's amazing . I liked it. I order it in 15.2.20 and it came in 18.2.20 fast delivery. And the photos are also good.
12021,5,Great camera for all beginners. I have been using it for an year. Great specs with this price. If you just a photography enthusiast then u should go for it.
12022,5,Nic camera. And Good and great quality of images and. Auto focus is excellent. Pixel density is Assom and mind blowing. Best dslr for mid level and professional photographer
12023,4,Great quality ... It's not a beginner camera ... It's a middle professional camera ... Good image quality ... I loved it
12024,5,every thing works fine except for auto focus excellent for photos terrible for videos one thing this camera can improve on is autofocus love the manual flash option for in built flash
12025,5,"Great camera for beginners and go for it if you are one. If you have a heavy pocket, my suggestion is to go for a full-frame(sensor) camera instead of this. This one is great, but eventually you'll need to upgrade to full-frame as you evolve and no longer be a beginner in photography.  Overall it's a good package with a wide range of lens compatibility, not only from Nikon but from other manufacturers as well."
12026,5,one of the best DSLR for beginners.. I upgraded from D3200 to D5600.. I'm loving it üòä
12027,5,awesome product for great value 36k I got this product at 36k which was awesome.and its genuine product criss checked with nikon site.go for it guys
12028,5,Camera nd picture qlty is so nice. Delivery is also fine. This camera fullfill all the need. It work fine nd battery backup also fine. Nikon is best for Picture Quality and colours.
12029,5,I am writing the review after one week of usage...  The product is just awesome! Performs very well in both indoor and outdoor photography. Low light performance is also upto the mark. Love this product. Unbeatable in this price range. 70-300 mm lens is adding more flavour to it‚ô•Ô∏è. Video recording is a bit concern. But never regret after buying it
12030,5,Worth for money. Packing was good and everything claimed by Flipkart was there in the box. Nikon D5600 is really a DSLR camera with a lot of functions and an excellent quality of pics.
12031,4,"Camera is pretty darn good as mentioned by other people. Bag was just pure awfulness, wore out in a few days."
12032,5,Writing review after usage. very good camera and clarity also good. 70 to 300 lens is very good. Best camera at this price for beginners. I am also beginner and added my photos
12033,5,Awesome purchase. Auto focussing and different effects are really positive of this product. Very impressive and easy to carry and handling.
12034,4,it is a good camera in a reasonable price.it is easy to handle and has descend battery back up.it was delivered safely.
12035,5,Excellent buy. Camera with 18-140mm lens is quite compact for DSLR standards. Nikon interface is easy to use for the first time Nikon buyers. Touch has right sensitivity and response . that really helps to focus the object with a touch of the finger rather than fiddling around with buttons. Images are quite sharp even on 140mm range.  Flipkart delivery was a let down. delivery executive just handed over the package to security gate without informing me. And the package was crushed outside. L...
12036,5,"After too much of research i decided to buy d5600 with 18-140mm lens. Any beginner planning to buy DSLR, this is the right choice. It's my first DSLR & I'm really happy with the service & product. Thank you flipkart for delivering it the very next day. Awesome packaging & lower pro bag is pretty good."
12037,5,"This is going to be quite funny.  I owned a Nikon D5200 and it pretty much served me well. I bought it for 16k from overkart (refurb) and it didn't have any complaints at all. Recently, I've been more into photography and thought of upgrading my d5200.  I didn't need a pro SLR as I ain't a full time photographer. But wanted a compact yet capable camera. I filtered out the suitable options and finally made into two ; Nikon D5600 and Canon 77d.  Now here begins the fun part. How to choose o..."
12038,4,My first DSLR. Nice and genuine camera sent by Flipkart. But was delivered after many followups and two weeks after the order. Got it for 34K (with one lens) on big billion day sale. Nice deal I guess.!! About picture quality and camera quality I will write soon.
12039,5,I have uploaded unboxing video on my YouTube channel ''Kushagra Porwal '' and firstly I have decided to buy Nikon D5300 instead of D5600 but only screen difference is there in both the cameras that D5300 has not a touch screen and D5600 has a touch screen and Nikon D5600 has a great video quality and has more functions Very good camera just go for it without any confusion and photo and video quality is also awesome. The camera has a flip screen which helps you to take selfies and is also goo...
12040,5,"First of all, excellent delivery and packing by flipkart. amazing camera. very compact and small in size. easy to handle. stand kit lens 18-55 is good and af speed is super fast and super quiet.  only drawback - snapbridge is really bad !!"
12041,5,I've been using it since couple of days and it just impressed me. I am a beginner in photography yet this camera helped me capture some stunning shots.
12042,5,"5 on 5 stars Excellent camera with awesome and crisp quality Easy to use for beginners with simple settings.. love this camera and the lens 18-140mm Bought it for 53,000/-"
12043,5,so overall experience was good but flipkart has to work on their problems regarding packaging. As a assured customer of a flipkart we believe in you while purchasing costly products so you should do packing well not only for your satisfaction but for customer satisfaction. when we saw product packing we felt a sheer disappointment..but we are giving 3/5 for early delivery of product only. so pleased work on it..
12044,5,Great product from flipkart and delivery period is very short I just loved flipkart delivery time period.... And also I wants to thank flipkart for the free gift of Samsung Bluetooth headfone.. And have got the Bluetooth headset with the nikon d5600....now just wants to click and enjoy my photography with the camera....
12045,5,"This one is master of Photography with Dual Kit Lens set, it is an amazing tool... awesome picture quality.  good sensor, nice shutter speed, larger range of ISO variation, 60fps video @1080P...makes it an awesome camera"
12046,5,"camera is 5 *, you can read enough on the net. Got at a very good deal , seller also shipped it on time but the courier ecom express delivered late , the outside box (carton ) was also damaged. Thankfully the inside packaging was good enough to prevent any damage. Flipkart and seller should ensure they send it via a reliable courier. I guess people will be willing to pay shipment to see their expensive items delivered on time and w/o damage. Btw I didnt receive any samsung headphone with the ..."
12047,4,"Excellent entry level dslr for someone who wants to upgrade from mobile photography. 2016 model but Nikon has not released any other camera in this range. Well packed. Received in good condition. 18-55 mm and 70-300 mm kit lenses are okay for beginners. However, to get pro like pics, one needs to learn some editing (all pro photographers shoots in RAW format and edit their pics) . The provided Nikon bag is okay to start with along with the two kit lenses. Image quality is superb. You can buy ..."
12048,5,Really a joy to use. Very good camera to start with. It is my first DSLR and I am really very happy with the images and the focus. Good for photography to begin with. Not so good for video as it hunts for focus when we move from a subject which is annoying. I don't do much video so I really love this camera?
12049,5,Bought the camera as my first SLR camera being a enthusiatic amature photographer. The main reason to go for this over the D3500 is the rotating touch display which helps more than you think. The photography related aspects of the camera is identical to the D3500 but the features are more and AF points are also a bit more. In the world of fast growing mirrorless cameras the D5600 is truly still a great option for any entry level photographer. Most pohotographer do not need a full frame camera...
12050,5,"Awesome choice for beginners. It is my first DSLR and I like it so much. Flipkart delivered it within the promised time. Wanted to tell about the bag, I received NIKON original bag."
12051,5,"superb DSLR ,brought for my daughter very good pic. quality nd video quality with good sound,go for it without any ifs nd buts....... ...u will definitely like this product...."
12052,5,Just loving it every time I use it. It's handy and very convenient to handle.Images are mind blowing but you really need to use it manually for better results than auto mode. Flipkart took hardly a day to deliver it and the packing was good. Go for it without a second thought!
12053,3,"Before time delivery, great service flipkart... Product is great as expected... Good discount... Nice packaging, Got wellness band free... Delighted"
12054,5,Bought the camera in a perfect deal. A nice cam that suits beginner to pro users with a lot many handy features. The 18-55 kit lens delivers a promising performance. I'm very much satisfied with it. Thanks Flipkart for a great deal.
12055,5,Amazing product if one has the budget he should buy this camera with the dual lens because the combo pack is so good. The components was not even touched. and the components were also very clean and brand new the only thing that which I don't like is the proper bill with the guarantee warranty card. I don't get the warranty card inside the box so please mention that point overall the camera was good all the components for not even touched very clean and I will give this product 5 rates. Thank...
12056,5,One of the best product in this price range. Picture quality is awesome. 0ackaging was good too and the delivery was at my doorstep. Thank you.
12057,5,"I am writing this review after using one month. I have bought the camera at 42k with the dslr body & and 18-55mm kit lens. The image quality of this camera is really awesome & amd the kit lens works really well. Low light photography is preety good. If you're a beginner like me, this camera's functions would be slightly complicated but after a little bit experience, you'll be able to capture great quality pictures even without external equipments. I'll highly recommend you to buy this product..."
12058,5,"The product works exactly as promised. It is a very convenient dslr with built in intervalometer and a flip out display which makes the photo making process hassle free and more such features are worth paying a little extra than getting a D3500 or related segment camera.  Only DRAWBACK is that the battery life is low and the battery charger doesn't carry a warranty. My charger took its last breath right after one month of purchase, so I had to go for a 3rd party charger.  But overall I'd s..."
12059,5,Nice camera with good features and touch screen. Go for manual mode for learning good photography skills. Skills are more important than the camera itself
12060,5,"Product is very good, all accessories are perfectly delivered. Camera quality is super, lense quality is good & brand new. 16 GB memory card & camera bag are also given with it. Lense cleaning kit is very useful & newly packed with warranty. It contains lense cleaner liquid, lense cleaner towel, lense cleaner tissue, cotton bud, dust blower and brush. The given uv filter doesn't bring any difference in photography, seems not so high in quality. Lense hood is also of good quality and it is tot..."
12061,5,A great camera for a beginner. Covers every aspect of photography. Easy to use and carry. Thanks to flipkart for such wonderful packaging of the product. I am a beginner and i have used it for 15 days n really loving it.

12064,5,"awesome DSLR... clarity is superb , purchased at the best possible price.. thanks Flipkart"
12065,5,"There is need to update the product description page, The product details haven't mentioned anything about camera bag, But seller do provide it. I have received the Lowepro camera bag. As usual the customer support from Flipkart is worst and pathetic , the customer support guys not only delayed my order but also gave misleading information, which leads you to regret your decision to order from flipkart again.  But, great delivery support from Ekart, the Ekart delivery person has gone beyond ..."

12068,5,"Camera is excellent. Just not satisfied with 18-55 mm lens, because i expect lens with automatic-manual switch. But this only manual lens. overall good product. and we get good quality images in 70-300 mm lens. great."
12069,5,It is a awesome camera and very easy to use . I highly recommend it for beginners. The delivery was on time and was it was packaged nicely.
12070,5,"First of all I am a new to the DSLR cameras.After a long search and continuous watching videos I decided to buy this camera.I read the all the reviews.Most of the reviews pointing towards the missing items and packaging.So I was ready to check the camera on arrival itself. 1)Camera package delivered before the expected date of delivery. 2)Packaging by Flipkart was awesome. 3)There is no seal breakage on D5600 as most of people wrote this one as negative. 3)Inside camera box,all items as per ..."
12071,5,"Well my review is supposed to be rated 4.5 rather than a 5, if I wrote this review without using the camera first. This camera is a great piece for people who are on a advanced beginner to a mid experience level. It offers all the functionalities that you would demand from a good DSLR and then it adds some tweaks here and there to spice up the experience for you.  What I was angry about was that the camera came with the AF-P lenses than AF-S lenses. Something I absolutely didn't see while ord..."

12076,5,"Great delivery and great product. Although the packaging was missing the sd card, but flipkart was quick to address it and provide me a gift card for the value of that card. Much appreciated work by flipkart team.  About the camera, it is an awesome device. I tried clicking some pictures in the lockdown and I got some really great result.  More details to come after some usage"

12078,5,First of all thanks for Flipkart for delivering in two days. Camera is simply awesome and cute in size Light weight Beautiful architecture of camera structure so pleasant in hands never felt bulky Camera bag is provided as complimentary which is a good thing Battery backup is good too I am a beginner so I can't give technical review But I have heard from so many people this is a best camera to become a pro and even I felt the same Touch screen is awesome
12079,5,best camera for beginners.. pretty easy to handle.. and great quality. for this price range this is the best. don't hesitate buying it.
12080,5,"good graphic ,has good clarity for taking photos and doing video recording best camera"
12081,4,"Amazing camera with awesome features and cool and user-friendly ergonomics, best budget DSLR , nice built quality ."
12082,5,I am very happy with flipkart as my wish came true due to big billion days. This DSLR is quite very good in performance and easy to handle. A starter can take very good photos with the given kit lens.
12083,4,"It's a awesome product, like dreams come true for me. very user-friendly features, handy. Comes with 16gb memory card, battery, adapter, dual lens, strap, bag & cam body. And the thing I must appreciate that, the fast delivery periode of Flipkart. thanks to flipkart and Nikon."

12085,5,Camera is Very good and flip kart facility is also very good but camera bag is not satisfied me.... All things in this camera package is good this packaging is very good by flipkart.....
12086,5,nice work and fast and their is many configurations and the best one in this price range but Nikon hv to improve it's manual copy which is just inside the retail box
12087,5,I simply love it. great autofocus awesome outputs. It rocks my videos. you can watch quality on my youtube channel which is Tech Geeks
12088,5,Good DSLR . Bought on sale . Thanks Flipkart and Seller Retailnet .Good Service .Keep it up ! Image quality is execellent. Kit is enough for an aspiring photographer.My dream come true to own a DSLR .Flipkart made it possible with a good offer.
12089,5,Very nice product. Thanks for retailnet seller for good packing and also got the 16gb memory card + camera bag (Nikon). As I am a beginner this is a very good camera to learn and to become a pro
12090,5,Product was just amazing and I'm so much satisfied with the kit. I recommend people who are at the Beginning stage of photography.I should also appreciate the delivery person because the delivery is on time and he delivered the product with a smile such a good person.
12091,5,Really a awesome dslr to go for. RAW images captured in this camera is very good and post processing results of images are also very good. As a photographer i‚Äôll recommend this camera for beginners. Buy a prime lens separately with this camera and thats it. U are good to go.üëç
12092,5,I am not an expert in photography but I am happy with quality of images in auto mode. I am trying to learn other skills of photography and fortunately I found its the right product I have purchased for both beginners and for expert's.
12093,4,If you want a super awesome dslr go for it. It has all the pro features you will ever need as a amateur photographer. Also go for a 50 mm lens if u want to shoot better bookeh effect
12094,5,Amazing experience of this dslr camera . Great clarity in photos . Five stars from my side. SnapBridge app make available photos transfer to the phone directly
12095,5,Awesome product fast printing and scanning is also good and it is easy to setup but it is not wireless otherwise awesome
12096,5,Excellent .. printer Hp desk jet 2331 . And you can must buy it üòâ.. i am really happy to my new printer..i think best low range best printer Hp .. Thanks and Thanks for Flipkart customer support ..
12097,5,Ink cartridge provided with it could not print even 60 black prints had to buy a refill ink .So if you have thought to buy remember to include the cost of the ink as well as the ink won't last long well the print quality is appreciable and good enough for home use .
12098,5,This product is good but the paper cost very high.. House Work is good but Business Work is Not Good..
12099,4,"Pathetic product, worst ever printing and scanning quality. Do not recommend this product to anyone, my 10 year old printer still works better with better quality output. Spend some extra money to get a better product else your money is wasted."
12100,5,"Extremely Good Product.The best print quality one can get. If you are on the track of purchasing it ,go ahead I can guarantee that you won't regret. A priceworthy and one of the best product by HP team to us .Thank You!!"
12101,5,very bad product... it shows low ink after printing arounrd 50 pages and ink cartridge is very costly around 2000 rs and prints only 100 pages go and buy another printer

12103,5,Supob printer
12104,3,Superb product
12105,3,Good product
12106,1,After 40 to 50 prints the ink cartridge will be low . Per printout the estimate cost is 5 to 7 rupees . And to buy another cartridge it cost around 800 rupees. It is very expensive because the ink will use more for print. I am really disappointed about the ink cartridge. It doesn't fit for small business or student because its ink cartridge is expensive and hardly we can take around 40 to 50 printout..
12107,5,Good printer but color takes too much for print...

12113,3,I like the printer look so much but the cartiage ink was empty In 50_60 pages or hp called it is only for trial purpose .or the speed of print out from pc is very slow main thing is the speed of print out from pc is very slow by the way the printer look and the photocopy speed is also good thank you
12114,4,Nice
12115,1,"Never buy an inkjet printer for any purpose because these printers could not be returned if u are not satisfied by it. Cartridge provided with the printer consist of low ink hp calling it as trial purpose ,after 2-3 fillings u have to buy new cartridge as it declared useless by the printer. Cartridges filling is not good idea in these printers as it wastes half of it's ink duing every cleaning. Buy ink tank printers as they are too efficient"

12601,5,"Super But scan process slow then inke is low ,less then 80 pages only copy"
12602,5,Very very slow printer and very high costly cartridge . If you print one page it will take 7 minutes to print one page . Very very high disappointed
12603,4,nice product no damage in this item
12604,5,Heavy use of ink used at the time of printing

12611,3,Super
12612,5,So amazing product
12613,4,Good
12614,2,This printout done by this useless printer. Totally wastage of money. I don't recommend this for anyone even not for my enemies. I hate this this product. And also ten days ago we filed a complaint but hp service center doesn't respond on my complaint.
12615,1,"Very nice printer, is worth the purchase. Ideal for Home printing but the black cartridge prints hardly 100 Pages and same with Color cartridge.The cartridge price is costly so I suggest you to Buy GoColor Canon compatible ink's each bottle is of 100 ML and you will find that there's is difference between Original and GoColor ink's. You can refill the cartridge at home in the kit you get everything just watch a video on YouTube and you will save you 96% Printing cost. I have done the same thi..."
12616,5,"great !! easy to use ,, budget friendly,, good printing quality,, looks comfortable, weight also user friendly"
12617,1,nice product I am a student I ordered this for my work I don't have a computer or a laptop I only have Android phones so I ordered that and now I print the worksheet from this printer very nice printer
12618,5,super Good delivery and canon printer is Good Quality.... value of money.. best product..
12619,4,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less  So my suggestion to all those people who want...
12620,5,"Was delivered within 48 hours. Not bad I must say since I ordered it during the current festive season.  What I got with this very neat looking printer -  1. connecting cables 2. color + black ink cartridges 3. Driver cd  Unlike in the reviews mentioned earlier, the printing speed is quite good, scanning is excellent and it just looks so neat sitting in my office back home.  Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.  Cheers to Flipkart :)"
12621,1,"I loved this oder . The delivery boy's behaviour was also good . Very good product, worth of money and i loved a feature that we can zerox,print and scan. In the last i want to say that very very very very good product.üëçüèªüëçüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªü•∞üòçüòò"
12622,5,"Looks great but it was very delicate piece nd also careful with plugin points as they are sensitive, overall it is best for home printers. Doesn't have bluetooth or wifi connection only works through cable. Printed nicely and easy to print."
12623,5,For the price of 1999 its a good deal. The printing is very slow. The copy and scan function works fine (good speed). Ink cartridge as usual are costly and one time purchase will sum up-to the printers cost.   The black ink cartridge won't even last 40 papers. Its showing low ink now. I am pretty sure color cartridge will be the same.
12624,5,"Timely delivery. Print quality is excellent. Easy to install. Got it at the best price. As usual, happy with my shopping experience"
12625,5,printer is very good but it's cartage is not good because it prints less than 100 copies and even after cartage is empty than new cartage cost is very high.. So I don't recommend this printer to anyone.
12626,1,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
12627,5,Very nice product . I am loving it . best printer at this price
12628,5,So far it's good . I got a little blinding edges but it's just minor details . The colour print quality is pretty amazing it's like the ones we get cafes . Yes buying the ink will be expensive . Printed some cartoons and I'm happy they look amazing.
12629,4,Amazing printer But cartridge is expansive But there is a way you can save your money by refilling your cartridge Just purchase ANG refill ink and fill cartridge You can see videos in youtube of cartridge refill By this way you can save your money upto 95 % Once again product is amazing Thanks flipkart for fast and safe delivery ‚ù§
12630,4,"PROS: 1. Available at cheap price. 2. Decent for less amount of printing. 3. Scanner is fast and colour accurate.  CONS: 1. Ink capacity is too low, hardly prints 40 pages with the cartridge included. 2. Print speed is too slow. 3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.  Suggestion: Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink! Happy Printing :)"
12631,5,Best thing is abt the cartridges are very easily available and they can be refilled as well unlike most of the other printer.  Scanning Quality and speed is great as compared to others.
12632,1,The product you sent me had faulty scanner.the service centre was nearby so.i got it fixed .. this not a good thing. But i am a kind person so i will buy another one and give this seller another chance ..  Btw its a good printer like hp1050
12633,5,"I am writing this review after 4 years of use. The printer worked fine for whole 4 years. Easy to scan and xerox. Print quality is good. Cartidge is costly. After using for 4.5 years, it is showing some software error. Canon Service Centre is asking for 2500/- (same as the printer price) to reset the processor IC of the printer. Hence I placed an order for a new one again from Flipkart."
12634,5,it works amazing with low cost printing quality is very nice . well product
12635,4,Pros: 1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot  Cons: 1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time 2. Makes lot of noise while printing.  Verdict: You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...
12636,5,it is good and viry high compartiable product it can scan fast and it can print with a good print its good printer so many of them should by withs seller
12637,5,This printer is good also it can be used to copy but this is not good for scanning. scanning option is seen anywhere. printing and coping is clear and good. good for homely use.
12638,5,"It's been a week since I bought the product and still haven't been successful in getting it connected to an android phone. Downloaded two apps and still not done. Such products should have longer duration for returns and should also have refund options. I still haven't managed. If there is anyone to support or guide, pls contact."
12639,3,"Well agree to some of the reviews made that it is slow, however note that it happens only while using it for the first time.  After the color test page is printed, you will see that the printing speed is comparatively better.  Ink Cartridge are a bit expensive and even one of the ink gets finished you wont be able to use Printer, the best alternative would be ink colors that are available in flipkart.  Delivery was as usual best by Flipkart."
12640,4,"Product Name: Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer (Grey White) -------------  Introduction: Multi-Function device that scans, copies and prints. -------------  Features/Uses: -------------- -Provided with a 1 year Canon India warranty -Supports USB 2.0 access and requires external power -Comes with software installation disk and color ink cartridges -The Canon PIXMA is an all-in-one printer that prints, scans, and copies  Advantages: ----------- -Offers support for Linux systems with..."
12641,3,This is the 2nd time I am buying this printer. This is a very good printer for ur home and not for heavy usage. I brought this printer again coz refilling of the catriges is very simple and can be done at home. I refilled my previous printer catriges almost 7-8 times. You can get many videos on utube on refilling Cannon pixma catriges. If u buy new cartriges it will cost u around Rs 600-700 for black and Rs 800-900 for colour. It's better if u refill the catriges at home every refilling will ...
12642,2,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
12643,5,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.
12644,2,Before time delivery and well packed. Very good printer for domestic use.. Good quality printing and scanning. Recommended product from my side in the price range.
12645,1,"Well despite the fact that its a good brand. The product is not worth buying. I bought it some 8 month back and believe me it has hardly given some good response and hardly got 30 copy printed. Such a Waste of money, instead get it xerox from store and get a good one."
12646,5,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
12647,5,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
12648,5,Packing is awsome ! Prints a bit slow but thats good enoght for that price ! Works fine
12649,4,Hey..! I've been using this canon pixma as my first printer for about 6 months..!  Pros : It is really cost efficient..my usual cartridge refill last about 2 months of basic home usage+projects 2. It is scanner + printer which both works fine. 3. Doesn't take much space and sheets Cons : Sometimes dont give efficient results.some smudges and print on paper Paper takes too much time to get recieved in printer Overall its a good product but only recomment it for home use.üéÄüéÄ
12650,4,Very nice product in affordable price.delivery was good.packing was awesome .printer working very much fine .
12651,5,This printer has helped a lot in my projects.Tjis is a gorgeous printer that I have never seen.The owner of this printer would be very happy and in a favorable mood since from first day of buying this printer.
12652,1,Superb very friendly for personal use very fast and good quality love it
12653,4,"Excellent product in seal pack . Lowest price for an all in one . Good quality printing , scanning . Easy to handle for personal use"
12654,4,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
12655,5,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."
12656,3,"Great product for an average user, it's perfect for office or school work and the best thing it's color cartridges ain't much costly either."
12657,5,LOVE THIS PRINTER AT THAT PRICE PROS- GOOD DPI PRINTING AND SHARP PRINTING THAN OTHER PRINTERS AT SAME PRICE FAST PHOTO SCANNING DRIVERS ARE AVILABLE IN ONLINE ALSO CARTRIAGES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN STORE EASSY SETUP AND HANDDLING REFIILABLE CARTRIGES SOME EXTRA ADDITIONAL PRINTING FETURES ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS PRINTER'S APPLICATION 80% MAINTANNCE AND DIAGNOSTICS ARE COMPLITED BY THE APPLICATION AVAILABLE ACANING QUALITY AND PRINTING QUALITY SETTINGS(MANUALLY) BEST FOR HOME USE UNIVERSEL US...
12658,5,printer is good but only give 100-150 black and White And 50-70 colour page in Starter Cartidge. And thr Photo Printing is Not Good... I recommend you to go for better printer. u can only use it if you are student.
12659,5,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy. Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day."
12660,5,it's compact for colour .it's too use 650 copies colours.and throw it. just use like use and throw product . simplyfy if one colour copy is 5 rupees the how much for 650 copies it's very useful
12661,5,A very great printing is done by this awesome printer. Budget friendly as well as excellent performance is what I review.Must buy from Flipkart cuz of amazing price and fast delivery.
12662,4,"Product quality is good. But the Ink cartridge is small with the printer in two numbers (ie. Colour & black) Refill cartridge cost above Rs.800/-. Flipkart delivery boy insisted the ""home"" delivery in our area, we given the delivery address clearly at the time of booking with Pincode. After few argument, finally they delivered ""on the road"" nearer to the address given. I am not happy with the delivery, that is why 2 star rating given."
12663,5,This product is good and very nice. at normal price and getting good quality product anyone can buy this product black and white colour print nice
12664,4,Nice work printer is good Light wait with nice print

12680,4,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
12681,5,such a nice machine it's not like ricket science easy to install works well compact design BUT it takes 2-3 seconds to dry the ink
12682,5,super nice and super cool
12683,5,Best t Best Buy on Flipkart nice to print absolutely fine
12684,4,"It is doing fairly good job in printing, scanning and copying. It comes very handy at home for children projects and small printing and photocopying tasks. One important thing to note: - in specifications, flipkart has given NO duplex print option. But it has MANUAL DUPLEX PRINTING OPTION. Printer interface is guiding how to change paper for printing on second side of the paper. I took printout on both sides of paper through MS word and PDF files. I am much satisfied with its performance."
12685,4,This printer works only 2 months after refined ink not work in perfectly
12686,4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
12687,5,"I got this for office work, prints and photo prints at home. Its amazingly user friendly i installed this and use it with laptop. Best part is they hv given both ink cartridges with this. I had A4 size paper with me. Only prob is it doesn't connects with any mobiles as USB point is for laptop or pc. I had to watch YouTube videos though as manual is bakwaas n cd dekhne ka tym nahi hai. But really excellent print outs n fast."
12688,5,"In this budget, it gives great service. I have bought it specially for scanning purpose. It gives good scanned images as well as scanned pdf documents. Its printing quality is also good."
12689,5,purchased this product a few days back. Recieved on time and it is working perfectly and value for money. the best all in one printer at affordable price. As i know it is the only printer with multi-functions and at such low cost in the market right now. So guys go for it.
12690,2,I'm a student and this printer is so helping me in project works and my many other works of schools. I like it .
12691,5,"The product is good and very easy to use but when we fill ink and use it causes some destructionions s,I wanted to say is it is good but follow instruction from given paper and also check in youtube how to operate and make it work thank uuuu"
12692,3,"good product, nice image printing, good zeros quality, I am Happy this product."
12693,4,Good at 1999 rs only. Cartridge price is more. but you can install ciss system to get affordable prints and easy to refill.
12694,5,"Great multi function printer at a great discounted price. printed picture quality is awesome, but using more ink cartridge than my regular hp printer. buy overall it's a great deal for 1999/-"
12695,5,i m using this printer continiously abd just working fine ..... print and xerox speed is quite good ..... ink is very costly bt for home use this is perfect ..... as usual flipkart delivered me tgis product as the scheduled time ..... packaging is good enough for damage protection .....

12704,5,"This printer was very good and the price is great the printer has multiple functions and it's very easy to take print package was very very nice thanks to #flipkart.The box contains printer,power cable,USB cable,and intalllination softwareCD"
12705,4,I got this product on big billion day 2014 for Rs 0.....yes....zero :) Have been using this product since. Works fine till now. The product is shipped with two partially filled cartridges- color and black which is the best thing because once your cartridges are finished you need around 2000 rs to buy new pair of cartridges. Refilling is also an option and work up to around 10 times on black but clarity will be on the downside. The main disadvantage is the ink consumption. Each time printer...
12706,4,"It is my heartful review about the product. I bougth this product last month at a resonable price of Rs.2500 and after expering its performance for a month I'm writing this. This is a good product to buy on comparing the other printers at this price range as it supports print, scan n copy options it is very good n efficient one n the only lag is it doesnt have the wireless faccility, otherwise it will be the ultimate one. As Im a loyal customer for flipkart, I wont hesitate to give a bad revi..."

12709,5,"This is really great product with print , scan , copy feature. Though the company promised that it will has normal speed, it is printing with excellent speed and quality. Very quality product from Canon and thanks for flipkart for this product and quick delivery."
12710,5,"Got a printer - All in one - for a steal!! Less than 3k is just good. That too, Canon. Performance is good but i am sure the ink is going to cost a lot. Hope it gives sufficient prints on a full cartridge. What i don't like about it is, it makes a lot of noise when fetching the paper in order to start printing. First i felt as if some part is broken. It was too loud. But then i realized, it is maybe because of the cost cutting that some things were compromised. Another issue is that it doesn'..."
12711,5,"Awesome product , quality product from canon . original , authentic product . well packed , same day delivery. good for office and also good for home use . just u have to refill cartage.. the only thing is its a lil bit slow in printing ,but no issue worth of money . go ahead . buy it !!! thanku flipkart ~!!!!!"
12712,4,"Excellent delivery by Flipkart. I got the printer by 2 days of ordered. Basically about this printer , I just say a good deal for home use purpose. It's quality of printing is OK but takes lil more ink than usual... Overall I am quite happy with it.."

12715,5,its good for such a low price . but the ink ends up so fast.scanning is perfect . on time delivery .iam satisfied with the product
12716,5,"Do you believe? About 80% of people are buying product based on the review and thats how these online shoppers gain trust..  Anyways, about this product its good and compact in design. It has few important features like coping, scanning etc. This product is worth to buy but the greatest drawback will lye on its cartridge. One black cartridge cost around Rs.800 and it can print only 150 pages so image the printer cost Rs.2400 but the single cartridge cost rs.800 now we can make out how we get ..."
12717,3,"The printer is good.Quality of printing is also good, easy to use and install. All the functions are very simple and easy to use. Good product and that too on very good price."

12724,5,"I got it for occasional use like getting photcopy, printing documents etc. have used it a couple of times since past 4 months its working fine, looks decent scanner, photcopy, printing quality both colour and black and white is decent for normal use...................... if u looking for ocassional use at home i would say............... go for it"
12725,5,its a good product i like it the print quality is awsome simple look copy is better than xerox machine
12726,4,I just wanted to print documents once in a while. Not a heavy user so it is good for me. It is light weight print quality is also good. Works fine with macbook. Colour is also good and presentable on any desk. If you are a heavy user or need it for professional prints maybe go for higher end models. Wish it was wireless but cant complain much at the price.
12727,4,"This is a printer for normal use... The photocopy and the print quality are good and clear. It does all my works of printing, scanning and photocopy. The only thing that i didnt like is that it makes sounds while printing. However it is an inkjet printer, all inkjet printer does that. Best buy at such price"
12728,4,Being delivering whatever I want from the time I got it. Perfect for home/official use. 2 to 3 months now and still holding up on the initial set of inks. Good product and I do not think one has to think twice for going for it. Delivered on time by Flipkart. Thanks for bringing the product to us.
12729,4,"This one made the life easy from day we bought it, previously it was like draining money for color printouts for kids projects and each color print out costed close to Rs 10. Once we had this printer hooking up was easy with Windows 7 and quick start up and then completing projects by kids was easy. The best was copy part kids can do by them self and color prints from system are as good as any color Xerox .  The only hiccup was ink, which would run out quickly if we do heavy printing, but w..."
12730,5,A budget printer with nice features at this price.... it gives out clarity print outs and the ink is also good go for it ......................................
12731,4,"this product comes out with the best price and best outcome. i am writing this review after taking print outs nearly 70 pages till now. it comes with cd and 2 ink cartridges , easy to install and use. A little bit nosiy when prints come out. other than that no issues till now. u can go for it. a great value for money i say."
12732,4,"Nice all in one printer. Ordered it last week and got it delivered in a day to my surprise :) Nice Packaging. It comes with 2 demo Cartridges (1 Black/1 Color). Printer auto detect on Windows 7 did not work. Installation of drivers from CD is a slow process and took around 30 mins. However, after installation, the Print quality and the scan quality is nice overall. Overall it'sa great vlaue for money (I got it at 2400/-) and a recommended buy for basic printing of documents/photos/copy/sc..."
12733,4,"good at this affordable price as it offers multifunction printing, scanning n copying and all working well.. but it is good for only small consumption rate"

12735,5,100% paise wasool Product I Don't Know about refilling but rest is awesome printing quality is very good can print picture to in very good quality at this price canon and flip-kart rocks delivery is very fast.
12736,5,Printer is good but cartridge capacity is too little.also it does not have led display like PIXMA 258. for multiple xerox copy u cant increase the no of copies from printer itself. you have to take each copy by pressing button again and again and printer will scan same copy everytime. sometime its very frustrating. rest is good and be aware that cartridge will run out of frequently
12737,5,a very good printer with very good specifications gives nice prints and colour prints are excellent if you know to refill the cartigde

12743,4,I fell in love with the product the moment I saw holy matrimony between the brand and the price tag :) Its a gorgeous product and extremely easy to install (no need of a specialist). It has a scanner and also gives B/W and Colour Prints which was a surprise. The quality of the prints is also very nice and can be easily used for projects and any home assignments.

12758,3,hi friends this multifunction printer is very good at working.it is an amazing product....i really love this.its the best product in the range of 2k.every thing is fine with this product but a small pron is that the catridge is a bit costlier to buy....
12759,5,printer is in good condition and its worth of price i got this only for 1800 . by purchasing through mobile app. and this printer is only suitable for home purpose.
12760,5,"It has amazing printing quality to its price value and its light weighted.. Amazing packing by Flipkart. If u r budgeted and looking for a nice printer with all in 3-in-one facility then, this is the best choice. 5 stars"
12761,5,Flipkart delivered this product before in time and in good condition ........... everything is fine ......regarding print quality it is ok and best suit for home purpose......
12762,5,Flipkart delivered this product in 4 days. Nice Packing. Printing quality and Photo Print Speed is too good. We cant expect more in this Budget. It crops scanned docs automatically. Its really nice feature time. Overall I m very satisfied with this. And Coming to Ink Cartridges cost is very high. Better to fix ciss ink tank.
12763,5,"This printer (Cannon PIXMA MG2470) provide excellent printout as well as scan quality. It has easy to use feature, simple and clear. The software provide easy to use function. The packing is excellent an there is no damage even to the cardboard cover"
12764,5,"i received this printer much before the standard delivery date, kudos to flipkart for fastest delivery.  The Product is a good and user friendly, however very slow in printing in comparison to HP all in one printer also the INK received along with printer gave hardly 70 prints in Black and white before it finished, Colour print wasn't used much hence not sure about how long it will last and price for a black ink cartridge is approximately between 800- 900 rupees.  The Scanner works pretty wel..."
12765,5,I received the printer with excellent packing & with well managed system. I unpacked & gave trail colour print out of Ashtavinayak wikepedia.Excellent prints came out. I am happy with printer and service also.  Thanks & Regards. Sujit Kulkarni. For Renuka Tech
12766,3,Prints slowly but an awesome choice at a reasonable price. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a printer at home. Flipkart does a great job in delevering the product on time with minimum hassle.
12767,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
12768,5,Pros: Cost: The MRP is 3995-/ but in flipkart is cost 2990.  Was well packed and got it on time.  It can be attached to your PC/Tablet.  Easy to configure and use. Drivers can also be found online.  Auto Power On/Off  Cons Printing takes more time

12788,1,good product
12789,4,Nice Product
12790,1,Ink consunption is very fast
12791,1,"Hi, this is Javed Who Purchased & Used this product since last 5 months, it is very good in pricing but it is very very bad in terms of maintaining, i mean it's ink, TOO COSTLY."
12792,1,Nice product with good discount Does the well. Just used it for 10 days  Have to c the cartridge consumption
12793,5,"Does the job. Nothing great. Nothing bad so far. Ink consumption is a bit high. But its ok for occasional prints,"
12794,4,After 10-20 copies the cartridge gets empty. You will have to buy a new ink cartridge @ RS 499 from Flipkart. So apparantly you will end up paying RS 25 per copy.
12795,5,Best Printer Low Price Best Quality.üëçi
12796,5,bad product because its error prints
12797,1,very very very very good super
12798,2,"Product is very very nice. Scanning, copying and printing all the three operations are very accurate. Nice quality of all three features. Setup of printer is also very user friendly."

12806,5,"cartridges are provided with this printer at the time in box package or not, because this is not specified in the sales"
12807,2,Please don't buy this printer.. the cartridge gets over after 20 prints and scanner sometimes strucks I would like to say you to go for a ink tank printer where you can add inks..
12808,1,wow after 8 months usage i sold this coz iNk prices 60% of the amount of printer !! Keep calm store money go with laser jet or something else which cartridge supports refilling QQ

12810,5,v good product
12811,5,this product as good
12812,1,please do not sale
12813,4,Dont buy this product guys this canon peoples are cheeters they dont know to manufacture the good product. i purchased 1 month back this printer. but no use boz it hase mentioned in to the cartrage that you can take 400 print were i took only 10 it showes cartrage is empty and i buyed new one that also same only 10. stop this selling product in to the market. now i need to through this printer to dustbin. do not buy it
12814,1,amazing and super thank you filpkart
12815,2,Good
12816,5,nice work
12817,5,Looking good and working system is very nice.
12818,5,too good
12819,1,by using two to three months its getting problems...
12820,1,One cartridge costs around 600(medium) and i am getting 15-18 pages per cartridge ..so approximately i am paying 30rs for a page printout. If you are looking for a scanner...fine go for it. price of printer is inversely proportional to rs you pay for pages. Go for some printer in range of 6k to 7k. In long term you will reap benefit.
12821,5,Very good product
12822,4,Not working properly..
12823,5,well finished pakage and the printer so u can buy it in cheap price.
12824,5,Its cartage will cost you a bomb.Lasts just 10 prints & costs Rs 800/-. Not worth it. Print quality is ok

12826,1,I take print in my hand really very nice

12831,1,The Black color cartridge can print only around 50-60 papers after that we need to buy a new one which cost around 800.  The print quality is good the cost of refilling is too high

12859,1,Printer is working fine and output is also great but it is a ink eater eats lots of ink for a couple of pages. . Cartridges prices are sky high.Thus giving 4 stars.  Canon should at least think of its consumers a bit.

13004,5,printer is best for home use. cartridge are costlier than HP. Got in Diwali season RS 1999/-
13005,3,the cartridge is quite expensive compared to printer and is hard to refill. they are earning more money through cartridge than printer itself.

13012,3,It gives very bad printing and it uses cartilage every day.
13013,2,Printers Price is good. Scanning are good. colour print out are 15-20 pages printed and ink cartridge over....
13014,1,Overall good...but loud sound while printing

13032,4,"It's a cheating seller , don't buy,"
13033,5,The printer is very good for printing and scanning @ home use. But its ink is expensive.
13034,1,"the performance of this printer in not good, printing speed is really bad and the main problem is the cartridge, it costs you too much every time and also not worth of the price."
13035,5,I have bought this product from flipkart just 4-5 weeks back and I am putting it up on OLX right away. 1. The scanner stops working if your ink runs out. Which is stupid because 2 functions should operate independently (like in HP - i should stuck to the same) 2. One ink cartridge gives only 6-7 full colour prints (i only use it to print pictures for my kid's school projects)\ Very annoying product.
13036,3,hello! please dont buy it this canon printer your lost your money printer is gud but cartage is so expensive colour pirice 1200 and black 1000. total cost 2200 printer cost 2300 and only 180 pages printe in one cartage
13037,2,I did not even give it one star .Very worst product. color print and black print does not print 10 pages also and it shows running on low ink . Never expected this from flipkart . I can't return it . Bad experience from flipkart. Worst printer ever .
13038,4,"Excellent printer, light weight, east to operate, ........................................................................................................."

13629,4,"Didn't meet expectations. Need to refill very frequently. While refilling it flows out from other end. Very less amount of ink remains inside cartridge resulting in printing for 15-20 papers only. And other issue is, even after refilling cartridge the yellow light will keep blinking. Would say don't go for this product."
13630,1,Faulty cartrige

13632,1,"Waste Product, Ink over In 1month"
13633,5,It's really Good

13662,1,It's good
13663,3,Not worthy & less productive.
13664,3,lovely
13665,3,Never by this product. It is really swindling to rob the credulous customers by selling them a comparatively cheaper printer and then to charge an exorbitant and unaffordable and grossly disproportionate price for the printer cartridges. The printer is never returnable as well. NEVER EVER BUY AND FALL A PREY TO THE SELLERS CUNNING TACTICS.
13666,5,Very bad product. Cartridge finish within 20 pages print. And the cartridge is not refilling. If the cartridge is finished you need to buy a new cartridge Which price is 700 and above. And no. off-page is very less in printing. Almost your per copy print approx Rs10-12 each in black.
13667,5,Printer bad working
13668,4,Very poor not working ink error .even after refilling
13669,5,This printer is very nice
13670,1,"Frankly speaking Guyzz don't buy this as for student purpose/home purpose because the cartridges is too costly and in one cartridge give only 50 sheets Afterall the printer is very good there is no doubt but not for as student purpose overall cost will be 10,000 in that you go for ink tank printers it will save you atleast you don't have to buy costly cartridges.

14521,2,"Cartridge (ink) price is very high i.e 700 per cartridge (ink) If u don't believe then contact to the offline shop..  companies who sell cheap printers are likely to sell more printers and get these customers and captive market for buying compatible cartridges. Even if a customer later regrets the price of ink cartridges, he is unlikely to buy a new printer just because the ink is so expensive."

14654,4,"It is a LCD MONITOR mentioned on the back and not LED, but they mentioned it as LED backlit. I replaced once but received the same LCD MONITOR with the model name as mentioned. Those who want to buy I request them to see the meaning of LED BACKLIT."
14655,5,Awesome product...

14679,5,Awosome!!
14680,5,Couldn't connect to monitor as the power cord provided is of 15 Amps plug and normally we switch to 5amp plug.
14681,2,The monitor is good. It come with the power connector which is used for high voltage items and it will not fit in a normal 3 pin plug. Yoh need a bigger plug which is used for AC for this cord. Have purchased another connector from market for it to fit in the standard extension cord.
14682,5,"Inferior product - one of the worst from Dell. Even a laptop screen second hand is better than this. Inferior quality LCD screen parts used. Display has round white marks within 10 days. Reducing clarity of display of numbers. Not recommended to use for work/business purposes.  Power plug send with this item is not of Indian standard. It is a very large power plug, send on purpose so that the return policy of 10 days will lapse."
14683,4,"Viewing Angle is just average; It's strange that the monitor requires 16A Socket, therefore doesn't fit in the normal socket; Not LED, the display is LCD, Title is misguiding the consumers; The package was already opened by the seller; Average HDMI cable, the display looks blurred using HDMI Cable; Made in China, the printed manufacturing date was Oct'20, can't speak about its reliability at this point; Other Points: Comes with HDMI Cable and VGA Cable for respective ports, along with 3.5mm A..."

14891,5,It is a amazing monitor. It supports fhd and suitable for you gaming consoles or pc.
14892,5,"This is a very standard 18.5 inches Monitor from Dell. There is one important information needs to be added that the power source cable of the monitor comes with a 16A plug and it is not possible to connect to our standard UPS. Hence either the cable needs to be replaced or the monitor needs to be connected to 16A plug point, which will not help during power cut. Due to this, I have not yet been able to check/test the visuals and performance of the monitor. Hope to update my review soon once ..."

14930,1,"Overall I am quite satisfied and happy with the monitor. The only reason I am give 4 star is due to the fact that the power cable that this monitor uses is a 16A one. This was a surprise as I did not expect a monitor to have a 16A input cable l. Had to buy a converter to get it working. This delayed the use by couple of days more. But other than that, this is a very good buy"

14979,5,"Product is good. It was available for Rs 500 less next day after ordering so felt cheated. Also beware it has 16A power cord (which is used for devices like Refrigerator, Washing machine) so it wont fit in your regular socket."
14980,5,The power plug/pin is too big.. does not fit anywhere. It's bigger than required for a refrigerator. Don't know why it requires so much power. ..The monitor is just okay but worth the price

15195,5,"It serves the purpose and it is beautiful. Let‚Äôs start the review with delivery. It was fast but the package box was a huge square shaped one with package inside. When I opened it and found the screen is beautiful and sleek. The packaging contained:- 1)vga cable 2) HDMI cable 3) stand for screen 4) screen 5) power cable 6) CD (I don‚Äôt know why I could not find CD drives on most of the latest laptops) So, it was easy to setup and I was able to do it in less than 5 mins. So here are some pros a..."
15196,4,"Before describing the monitor itself, I want to mention that I am extremely pleased by the seller and delivery. I ordered this on Saturday afternoon and I had it with me on Sunday afternoon. Fastest delivery that I've ever had.  The box comes with a HDMI and a VGA cable. The screen has a very basic I/O: Just one for VGA and HDMI each. No speakers on the monitor. The monitor stand is fixed, cannot be adjusted for height or swivel. That said, it looks very nice on my desk. The screen is very sl..."
15197,5,"Perfect aspect ratio , colours are good . Slim and sleek design . Best in this price range ."
15198,5,"Not five star because the response time is not suitable for gaming purposes therefore it is a general purpose monitor. Hope this helps. Brightness is good, and its a good one at this price specially impressed by the 3 year guarantee claim made by the dealer."
15199,5,Got this beauty at just 9300. A pretty good deal for a 24inch IPS monitor. Great color production and the looks pretty slick.
15200,3,Amazing Value For Money Monitor  I Use This Excellent Display 15 Days Amazing Response  (1) HDMI Cable (2) Amazing Screen (3) power Cable
15201,5,Awesome product. Nice display. Gives some flickering in screen if connected via VGA but crystal clear clarity if connected via HDMI. Worth buying and value for money.
15202,5,"I've been using it since a year and here is my conclusion... the display is very good colours are accurate and the resolution is really full hd and it gives full screen experience, just the bezel at the bottom is a bit annoying. there are some difference in colours of monitor and smartphone or other device but I noticed it in every monitor. all and all it's a good product, you should try it out."
15203,5,Proudly Saying take it as early as possible if you think to take any monitor....kindly go for it without any hesitation and too much thinking.... today it's arrived at my place and after installation really I just wondered to see bcz it's fully screen and when I started a video in YouTube with highest resolution I just wondered to see what Crystal clear picture I can't explain and when I start a high resolution game it's give me my dream picture of the characters and others features was tooo...
15204,5,"Do not think twice before purchasing it some will say lg display is good samsung is better, it has a response time of 7 ms which is slower than usual and u are here searching for an IPS panel monitor it clears that u want a good picture quality and video experience so go for it don't listen to any other if u take it then u will give a review here like me.."
15205,4,"It's a good product (only been 1 week though, will update later on). Looks good. Works well. Sleek, light weight.  Following are some nit-picking from the initial experience: Not easily accessible ports (These are behind screen; hidden).It could have been way better if these would have been on the side. The stand is good looking, but not practical. It's not height adjustable."
15206,5,"Awsome quality, best moniter in this price, perfect & true color for photo & video, best moniter for photoshop working & video editing.. Loved it.. Thanku flipkart.. Flipkart service is very good before time delivery i loved it."
15207,5,Happy to see the things u like on the big screen with affordable price. Thank u flip kart and hp
15208,5,"overall product good , this is non vesa mount led so you can't mount directly .. you want to need vesa adapter and it's very light weight so not stable in fan wind on table."

When I take it to hp service center they saying whatever problem u can return that and get new one and quoted price more than online price. So the point is if u struck in any problem.

15589,5,"Ordered this and next day delivered (Rs.1699.00) Flipkart packaging is not good in this item only a poly pack but delivered without any damages and got recently manufactured product Oct/2020.  About this product: 1) Subwoofer Bass 5/5 2) Satellite speaker 3/5 Sound is good but it is mentioned 10 X 4 = 40 watt, it sounds like total output of about 10-15 watt only except subwoofer not because the speaker but inbuilt circuit board. Although this home theatre's sound is enough for me (12X10 room..."
15590,5,An average product which gives a decent output. Dont expect above average. As i also have a Intex 4.1 which is a old one bought before 10 years which is producing a good bass and sound output. But this product is just like a speaker box.. If u want a normal speaker with a minimal bass go for it. If u want a home theater effect dont go for it. While taking the price into consideration the speaker is good for the amount.
15591,5,Completely mind blowing speaker more than my expectations and pocket friendly I'm very satisfied with the sound quality.... Very good all features work perfectly and fluent..!!
15592,5,Nice product. Nice sound. The advantage is it have led light and 4 speaker
15593,4,Best buy in low budget. Sound quality is not that great however sound clarity is pretty good. I recommend to put some more money and get a good quality sound system if you are a music lover. It's good for people with low budget who are ok with so so sound system clarity. The material used is low quality so eventually you have to replace your system may be in a year or two. All functions mentions work perfectly fine. Good for your bedroom. Not recommended for living room.
15594,4,"Good product valuable for money I like it, if u selecting for a better quality home theater under cheapest rate I preferd for u this b/s it's good and good quality one"
15595,5,"Good design.. I bought it in1500 so in this price ""value for money "" But according 55watt speakern i dont think its sound Average product ...but ok & perfect for this prise range Edited rivew after 6 month use i dont think it is a good product BASE Is good bt the vocal & noice is very bad sound like 10 watt blootooth sepaker"

17745,5,"First of all I am not recommending to buy this item due to following reasons:  1) Even though it is having 4 antennas, the range, I mean the strength of the Wifi signal is very much less than that of Netgear / TP Link routers with single antenna.  2) Most of the tools or features in the MiWifi app are not working.  3) Connectivity details are in China Language as usual.  4) It is very difficult to search for a password. Since No where it is mentioned.  5) Very difficult to mount on the wall. ..."
17746,5,These Router is just awesome.. I have used Mi Router 3c and now i ordered this one 4c.. This one is just an upgrade to the other one. But it works fine.. Not a single.issue till now using 3c from about a year and 6 months.. Using thia one from past 3 days the speed is good as per my plan no problems with any connections.. Look is also good but the thing which stops me to buy is the Company which is basically a chinese brand.. This is my last thing which i will be purchasing that is made in ch...
17747,5,"Smart features,looks is also impressive and app optimization is so good I like the overall extraordinary product."
17748,5,Good value for money product  Range-good  Speed - If your connection below 100 mbps so that it's good for you. But if you have more than 100 mbps connection so better you choose a dual band(5ghz) router
17749,5,Genuinely MI products are good and I am using all the products of Mi And I need to say about the MI router is after 2 weeks of usage is suddenly shut down and it is not even blinking the lights on top of Mi router I have seen a big issue with this MI router and I want to suggest you people to take the other best companies for your router I am saying genuinely to you all you have buying to take this product From Hyderabad Alwal
17750,5,GOOD PRODUCT & SOME CONS  MIWIFI QUALITY IS SUPER SOLID PERFORMANCE IS ALSO BEST AT THIS PRICE SEGMENT ROUTER HAS NEW FEATURE CALLED SIGNAL WALL PENETRATE MODE ALSO YOU CAN WIFI CONTROL APP (MIWIFI) FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE BUT ONLY I HAVE ONE ISSUE [CHINESE PRODUCTS MOSTLY SPYING YOUR DATA SO MAYBE IT'S ALSO SPYING OR NOT ]
17751,5,"Just like a normal router, works well and as expected but nothing special.  It has those basic features as of all routes which includes :- 1. Bandwidth Control for some devices 2. Hiding the network SSID 3. Total data monitoring   However, even thought it as 4 antennas, the range is very low (I am not running it on 5 GHz otherwise it will be much lower). When I go onto rooftop (just above my room) the signal drops and only 1 bar of signal is available. Not to mention it only covers the place ..."
17752,1,It's really awesome products nice design with good inbuilt feature makes it a pro level WiFi router as I have at the moment 2 system working as we are working from home also 6 other mobiles are connected but I am getting a good speed to all the connections.
17753,4,4 antennas do not actually make any difference in reality..router is good but quality of signal gets generated in not that strong...when it comes to penetrate 3 walls it failed to show the power..works better with mi devices like phones or laptop compares to others...does not have a signal quality selector like only n or b/g/n
17754,5,Best router at this price range. It's very compact and lightweight. Though it's wi-fi range is not of some 4 antenna router still it's pretty good compared to other routers at this price range.
17755,5,Nice Product........ It's an amazing product which is having 4 antennas for giving a wider range of connectivity.And it is an absolute SMART ROUTER which has the option of getting the details of all the connected devices.You can also set the daily data quota which will save your data if you are having a limited data plan from your ISP.  You can additionally connect up to 64 devices at a time without losing any speed.  The range is not so good as I have expected.... It is not giving an adequat...
17756,1,Very good connectivity and range a bit less tried sign strength is good but if you go far about 10m it wouldn't give good signals. And app connectivity is easy to manage new and guest accounts. Overall a satisfied purchase from flipkart. And it's not a dual band wifi it's operates on 2.4 GHz band.
17757,5,Best Router in this segment...Go for it üëç Better than other brands like TP Link or D-Link. This router has various features and attractive sleek design with matte looks which wins your heart at first look. And 4 high gain antennas are outstanding...It covers my 3 BHK easily. Easy to use and beat thing is that you can easily access this from your phone... loaded with features.  In layman language...This router easily sync with your day-to-day life.  Thanks.
17758,3,The product is a really good product from Mi as it doesn't take much time to setup and minimum technical skill would be required to set this thing up...it is also easy to use by tha app and gives you full control over the device. A smart router in true sense.  Now after this why have I gave this 2 star...simple only one reason the packaging that I have got today and about this I won't write in details over here but rather I am sharing 2 photos which will be enough
17759,5,"most trusted band router with excellent product and work smoothly through MI WIFI app. thank flipkart and thank MI band ,nice looking and performing product ,I recommend all router user in INDIA to use mi router .Thank You."
17760,3,Its a superb router to have......but remember one thing dont purchase this router by looking into the 4 antennas...!! Its a router worthy of range what u get from 2 antennas only. Its a good router u have app support as well. Very good interface u can easily check if any unwanted one is using ur router. Good to have .....go for it .... Vfm (value for money) for sure ..!!
17761,5,Wonderful purchase!!! üòÉüòÉ The best product at this price... There is no router at this price this good... Lookswise also very sleek and elegant ‚ù§‚ù§ very happy! Must buy!!! üíï
17762,4,"Using it as a range extender (wired) , woking like a charm for me, Myth about ping ,it depends on your location like if you live in metro cities your ping will be very low (because metero cities have Larger number of servers) but if you live in small cities or town (like me) no matter which connection you buy your ping will never match with metero cities( because firstly our city server send their data to these metro cities server) trust me I've have tried many FTTH connection and never get..."
17763,5,Range is not good else ok..its good only for 1 bhk but you have to place in center then u will get proper connectivity
17764,5,"I am writing this review after one month of uses of the another great product from xiomi... First of all the interface of the app to access the router is very simple.. keep is mind if you need more than 2 lan port this product is surely not for you, otherwise blindly go for it... If you have big house like me then it is the best router you can get to cover all the rooms.."
17765,2,Great router. Just don't think that because of the 4 sticks it is gonna have exceptional range. Good product for its price.
17766,5,Love the product....not so good built quality ..but works very well and that too at very reasonable price
17767,5,Product was excellent the speed for. Playing youtube is awesome n we can connect upto 64 devices new device notification is also available n bandwidth speed is also set by ours
17768,5,"Using this as a Wireless Repeater. Working perfectly. No issues. Very few Setup steps, which is extremely helpful."
17769,5,"Edit: Problem solved after replacing the ISP modem provided by local ISP.  Old review:Have lots of features but there is no stability in the connection, but actual broadband connection is stable! Also wifi connects and disconnects frequently."

17774,5,Very bad
17775,5,Worst router
17776,5,Great
17777,5,I purchased this router to extend JIOFI range but JIOFY itself provides far better coverage than this router. There is no refund option so I think I wasted my hard earned money :(
17778,5,Excellent Router from Mi in this price point. I asked few broadband technician about the product they said perfect router for home to office work.

17784,1,"Pls don't buy MI ROUTER. it's a very bad router. Maximum 10 miter are covered. It's very worst router. I thik TP link is much better. So, don't buy. After all it's have no refund policy. Only replacement policy."
17785,5,Worest router it's range is upto a single bedroom my Digisol single antena router is better than this one.Dont waste your money i returned it and return policy also very tough very very low range i think it is waste to have 4 antena single antena router is best than this one..
17786,1,Good Router having rich user interface alongwith mobile application. But does not meet my expectations. Some drawbacks are:-- 1. Range is not good in coparision to Dlink DIR-615 2. Does not assign static IP to router in Reapeater Mode(Wired or wireless)
17787,4,Nice!Nice Boostin&High Speed
17788,5,"Range is poor, rest everything is fantastic! I keep almost 8-9 device connected and all work flawless.  Since the range is less, keep it somewhere where it can send signals throughout the flat.  Hardware needs improvement, Software is best that nobody else gives."
17789,1,Pathetic product.. totally waste of money
17790,5,"It's bad. It don't give range. My friend and me took it 2 router together. Both router are bad. We have a plan of 5mbps, but it give20 kbps speed. West of money"

Router Gets disconnected From internet very often for about 30-40 sec and again start working , i never faced this issue with my tp link router.. despite having 4 antenna range covarage is very poor my old Router was better .. guys just buy any dlink or tp-link Router .."

17799,1,"I am using this as a repeater.. pros: 1. smart looks 2.easy configuration 3. wifi range is good but had more expectation as it has 4 antennas. Cons: 1.sometimes too much packet loss 20% to 50%.Then it become very irritating while online gaming. 2.features are limited in repeater mode. 3.speed decreases up to 30% 4.It has a heating issue,but acceptable. 5.hardware is not the best  With a little more money you can get a better router of dilnk or tplink..."

17869,1,Nice product
17870,1,Best router in this budget segment.... Really awesome product. I love it so much
17871,5,Used this for almost a month. If you are spending 1K to get this. Would recommend to get a DLink for 1.5k. Because this MI router will give you high ping. Low wifi coverage. The connection will break if you are in a different room. In case you have a old build property then the scenerio would get even worse.
17872,4,Very good product no issue of coverage i don't know why everyone is complaining about the range i live on 3rd floor and the network reaches the ground floor too . Very satisfied
17873,4,Good on this price range.
17874,5,Router is exceptional.. Every one complaining about range but it is working gem for me as it is covering entire my house with full signal and even down floor with 3points.... Thank you flipkart for speedy delivery and delivering me orginal product
17875,4,Good product fot that price i liked it buy it guys.
17876,4,Ok ok product.. Range is not what i expected.. 4 antennas are just for the showcase nothing else.
17877,5,Good router for extender use and daily use...Buy it and enjoy with low price 4 antenna best quality
17878,2,Good Product
17879,5,I have used more than 2 months now. It is very good. Especially the internet monitoring and connection monitering UI in the system is very useful.

18096,3,Very easy to use router. The only negative point being sometimes the wifi network drops abruptly. I use it as bridge router and is working just fine. There was no packaging at all. I was delivered the box as it is as shared in pictures. The cover I think was not of the size so they didn't bothered to cover it up at all or provide any type of protection.
18097,3,Overall good
18098,5,nice

18104,4,Very nice
18105,5,Range is not good
18106,5,Range is very poor can't even cover a single story building. and is slower than the other counterparts. I would suggest to buy TP link.
18107,5,Beat
18108,5,The monitoring features is very good in MI router.
18109,5,Mi router 4C is the best wifi extender I have ever used. The best part is you can control all its features via Mi wifi app which is very easy to use. The network coverage is also very very good and this very easy to install and configure. I just want to mention one thing that I was little disappointed by the packaging flipkart provided. The router was not even wrapped in paper. The original packaging was also damaged because it was not wrapped.
18110,3,Too tough to connect with the app. Each and every time it shows error. :-(
18111,5,Ok thank you safe deliveryüëå

18129,5,"First time when connected, the RJ45 connector not inserted in the WAN port of the router, due to which no internet, After cutting and pressing the connector then with great difficulty it went in side the WAN port. Very poor router built quality Nothing great about the speed, I have 200Mbps plan and I get only 40Mbps from router"
18130,1,Very basic 2.4 Ghz Wifi Router . Easy to set up and use but Drops Internet once in a while and then gets connected by itself . OK for the price but better if you upgrade to a more stable dual band router
18131,4,"Nice bt some problem I face to configure,,,bt nice"
18132,4,Over all good.... But i mention that the of this router is not as expected... The four antennas are just show off i think.... Considering this the router is good... You can buy it... Over all decent product... Does the job
18133,5,Super
18134,5,Excellent
18135,5,Best Router i like it üòçüòç

18137,2,Bad
18138,4,"Good product. Don't have any complaints. Easy to configure Flipkart delivered very quickly, thanks for it..."
18139,5,Good for 1BHK apartment. Would not recommend for anything larger than that. Don't fall for those 4 antennas! App is user friendly. It provides features like bandwidth control for individual devices which comes in handy if you have a limited plan. If not for the area coverage its good in this budget.
18140,4,After 1 year problem occurs I was using this as a repeater my other wifi tht I am using since 4 year speed is awesome however as a repeater net speed is very bad.... In the beginning it was awesome...
18141,5,"Super product. I ordered pn 26th June 2021 and got delivered on 27th June 2021.  Good product, covers all over the house, can be used as a router or as a wifi extender."

18157,5,Good product
18158,5,I purchased this Mi router from flipkart after one of my cousin recommended me this. After installing this in my living room the wifi coverage problem is totally solved and the best part is that you can control all its features via Mi wifi app. Xiaomi as always is providing best value for money products in every category.

18455,4,It's a good product from xiaomi. AboutAbout 30 metre range I'm impressed
18456,5,The product is extremely difficult to mount. As it can only be placed on a table. Signal strength won't be good enough if you expect signals in one room with the router in another. Don't go for it.
18457,5,Signal strength is so weak .
18458,5,Good üëç ü•∞300mps speed

18659,5,Worst Item Dont Purchase Signal Strength Weak UI Management so difficult Many Reasons found to say
18660,5,No signal strength.. worst performance.. money waste
18661,5,Good
18662,5,Good
18663,5,Worst range
18664,5,Poor range.
18665,5,It's range is not good.
18666,1,Easy to configure and good coverage for a small house.  Compare to other devices it gave me hassle free configuration and moreover it's easy to install. Also the wire connector is big enough to keep distance.  However if you are looking for high speed more then 100mbps and bigger house then this would not fullfil your requirements.
18667,1,Wi-Fi low range
18668,5,NB :. It is a router not a modem.. It is only used to extend the connection and increase the coverage and speed  Don't underestimate it is the only thing needed for a broadband connection . A modem is also needed.
18669,4,The range is not working at all. Even doesn't reach ground floor from first floor.
18670,2,Don't purchase. Wifi range is too bad. After 6 month . Wifi Problems start . Download speed 400kbps on wifi. I have 100mbps plan on Airtel fiber .
18671,2,I'm using it as a wifi extender.. It serves the purpose
18672,3,Nice
18673,4,wifi range is too low
18674,1,Perfect
18675,4,Not good
18676,2,Good

18733,5,Very Good Products and Weight is very Low..
18734,5,Reng very bad
18735,5,Very nice product but the frequency of the router is decreasing day by day
18736,5,network not proper
18737,4,im not recommded this router for more than 1000sqft area.signal strength is average.you can increase signal strenth by applying silver foil.miwifi app is really excellent. it can fully access to all devices connected to your wifi you can also set speed limit for specific devices.
18738,3,Nice
18739,5,Best in class
18740,5,Thanks üòä

18743,1,Awesome
18744,3,"For Home use its okk..But if u r thinking for office use plz go for another product..response time is very slow, by the way looks and design is good.. overall average product"
18745,5,Good
18746,5,Great product but there is no wps button and there is not hole so that we can hang it to the wall for this reason i have given it four star ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê other than that no problem
18747,5,Easy to Install and Faster Download
18748,5,Range is low
18749,5,Nice
18750,4,Good
18751,3,"Useless product, not working properly, not giving full signal in 3 meter range."
18752,4,nice
18753,4,Good product
18754,5,Raise your money üí∞ so bad
18755,3,Nice product
18756,4,Very bad range. Four antenna attracts to purchase at that price. But performance is not even equal to some other two antenna router's. I regret this purchase üòè
18757,5,Ping is very worst
18758,1,Very very bad . don't by this router
18759,5,The Product Received on time and it was very good It was the value for money...!!
18760,5,Poor range Speed is also average. Go for some other options like tenda or D-Link
18761,1,Very good product. Working so fast.
18762,5,Good in signal üì∂strength
18763,2,Nice üëç product
18764,1,That product is very bad connectivity is very poor I am not recommended to buy . product only 10 days is not working .my rating is zero
18765,1,Faltu product
18766,4,Looks wise it's quite good. But the main reason for which anyone would buy this i.e. using the wifi the experience is not so good. Despite of having four antennas I'm not sure why it's range is not so good. It should be okay for two rooms. But beyond that one should not consider this.
18767,2,Very good product
18768,4,BEST IN CLASS.....................!
18769,5,It's very Nice and very Good Connectivity
18770,5,"average coverage,network speed distribution is awesome.....Thats all.."
18771,1,Range problem
18772,1,Poor signal quality
18773,3,I can give 4 star coz rage very good compared to D-Link. If u all have 2 BHK then this is very good for coverage even in washroom... Build is ok ok.. And very slim looks suprb Con:- Wire is too short... Two lane port
18774,5,Wrost router I have ever used. 50 Mbps connection but speed from router doesn't go beyond 10 Mbps. I suggest you all to do not buy this. It will waste your money. Even the response of company is also very very bad.
18775,5,Range gets dropping down in every month I'm using 100mps speed this router is not proving the range on this Totally un satisfied with the product...
18776,5,Range of 4 antena is too low as 1antenaüôÑ
18777,4,I can believe on mi after closing eyes.really it is nice product..
18778,1,Good
18779,1,Range is not up to the mark As accepted
18780,4,Very good
18781,1,Nice product
18782,1,Range is not as expected Only 15 meters range *in home I think this 4 antenna is not performing only one is active
18783,2,"I expect more range... But it provides almost every same range like tp-link, D-Link as this price range, otherwise it's a Good option.."
18784,5,Nice
18785,5,Wi-Fi Connecting problem auto Disconnecting and connect again after 2 min. I'm return this product.
18786,3,One of the best wifi router at affordable price

18792,1,Good product
18793,5,The best router in this price range. This is my second purchase and this time it is being used as a repeater. The setup is very simple and intuitive. Only thing I hope is addition of 5Ghz in the next upgrade at this price point.
18794,5,It's is very bad product not working properly

18800,5,It's a nice product.
18801,1,I've been using it for 1 month. Best product in market. *value for price *good range *more than enough speed(after using it as a secondary router too) *the web portal is very much user friendly. *one tap convert... (as a router or repeater(wireless and wired) through the mobile app).  ** the mobile app actually does nothing but starts the connectivity.  After all.. You can buy the product if you get it under 1k.
18802,5,Network coverage is too bad.
18803,1,Terrible purchase Used 1day but wifi range is horrible even speed is too not good. 4 antenas not working and covering i think
18804,5,Bohut acha hai nice warking ü§óü§óü§óü§ó
18805,5,The Best
18806,3,It didn't work only when tried before installation ....
18807,5,"Worst product. Mi router 3C was much better than this. Range of this router is not good when compared to the Mi 3C router. Mi 3C router has the advantage of running on powerbank but not 4C. If you are looking for good range, this one is not for you. Go for Tenda N301 or TP-Link 841N if your budget is around thousand rupees."
18808,5,Very easy to configure. Nice speed. Nice looking device from MI. Thanks Flipkart for awesome delivery experience
18809,2,Very poor poor range even my house is small but range doesn't cross even 10ft üò°üò°i used only 1 day
18810,1,Previously i was using mi router 3c it has good coverage This 4c model doesn't give even half of the strength of old router Really disappointing worse than mobile hotspot
18811,4,I like it but only two lan port
18812,5,An average router. Don't buy it if you are looking for high range.

18835,2,Pole item super net
18836,5,I love this product.. product price is very good as compared to other router.. but one demerit i have notice that tha range of MI router is too short.. overall product is very good .. but range of a router is not suitable for long distance around 450sq.ft.
18837,5,It is a damaged product
18838,4,The shipment was nice
18839,1,"4 antenna is just overkill, it isn't any better than tp link or D-Link 2 antenna models. The best part of this router is its software. Very useful and use to use."
18840,5,Super router very easy setup n good speed
18841,1,Mesmerizing.
18842,5,good product
18843,5,All good but range is low
18844,1,"Good product, I am using it as repeater for enhancing the existing wifi signals into the non covered area of my house. Good product. Very simple to setup through its mi wifi app."
18845,5,I thought my girlfriend is the best thing but this wifi proved me wrong
18846,4,Coverage is very bad... those 4 anntenas of no useüëéüèº
18847,5,Value for money
18848,5,Too good. But its china product.
18849,5,The range of the WiFi is not at all good. If you want to use it in 2 small rooms nearby then only it's good. Else go for something else.
18850,5,Don't buy this speed and range not good.Buy more trusted brands like Tplink and D-Link.My D-Link router covers almost half of home but this router can't even a single room.
18851,4,Good Product

18875,2,Awesome product it's working absolutely fine
18876,4,Nice flipkart
18877,1,"Light weight. No hook holes to hang. Four antennas are good. Minimal design. One main Lan port, two child Lan ports."
18878,1,Worst product ever
18879,4,Delivery man was too awesome üëçüëèüëèüëè thanks flipkart
18880,1,Not good range sometimes disconnect network
18881,5,"Good at this price range, single band(2.4 gHz).The router has 4 antenna, but they are for showing, range is good for small room. I even can't get signal at ground floor, my router is placed at 1st floor. Good for this price point."
18882,5,I bought this router last week firstly I felt that some technical issues should happened but after 1week also same problem happened with me again and again don‚Äôt buy this it won‚Äôt cover a single floor also very bad coverage.
18883,5,Very poor signal range.
18884,4,Very bad router .
18885,1,Best quality nice to work
18886,5,Best product
18887,2,"Hanged at a place were it can reach my complete home, product is very light and powerful and easy to install. We can control it by using Mi WiFi app"
18888,3,Good Product
18889,1,Thanks filpkart
18890,1,Very poor range. Highly disappointed with the performance. I was using tenda and d-link routers(both having single antenna) before opting for this router. I was expecting a big boost on the range but after using it i am shocked to see the poor reception. I‚Äôll strictly not recommend this router to anyone mainly cos of its poor range
18891,1,Very low coverage. Better to go for TP link
18892,5,Ruff tum all jaan
18893,5,"Best router ,,, amazing experience with mi . It covers my all rooms and speed is superb and through mi wifi app its super duper cool and easy to connect ..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüëç"
18894,4,Overall an average Router! Good point: Very light weight Very nice design Easy to setup and manage through mobile app. Can be used as repeater.  Cons: Range is average even though it has 4 antennas. Less than my current router with 2 antennas. Have only 2 lan ports. Dont have a hole for hanging on wall. So you have to keep it on some surface.  More ports and a modem port for telephone line would have been added advantage but modem does not have it.  Overall a good average router. I use it as...
18895,5,This is very good quality product and my work is very well
18896,4,Excellent stability Excellent strength Low range coverage
18897,1,Good
18898,3,After usage of 4months. Its really nice product.
18899,5,"Good in terms of speed and fast connectivity, however the range is soo poor that am unable to connect it beyond 15 meters on any side even after making sure there are no signal interferences"
18900,5,Awesome
18901,3,Wi-Fi range is not satisfactory..
18902,5,Nice product. I have installed on ground floor and access internet on first floor as well.
18903,5,"Doesn't give much range, but good enough within a small range"
18904,3,It's good for home daily use.Easy to setup with a little tutorial.But if you have plans to connect your house having too many walls and obstructions it can be a little let down at the furthest point.Still the connectivity received is appreciable.Given the price point in which you get its more than your expectations.The app led monitoring feature is a real delight.
18905,4,The connectivity is not even there from 10metres of router whenever there is a power off the router doesn't connect with the internet it is not working properly can't even switch off the router
18906,3,Very Good Quality
18907,5,Very nice router. Worth buying it.
18908,4,"Heavy duty router , best of all 1 k range , performance peaks and lets see for how many months it will last"
18909,5,"Timely delivery. The product works good so far but it would be too early to say anything. I have a problem with the seller, as the product was sent without external packing. When I received parcel, the original box was wet and Mishandled."
18910,5,A smart product
18911,4,It is average
18912,1,Disgusting every time Wi-Fi was disconnecting and also Wi-Fi range was not good if range is below 3 nothing can work

18944,3,Good
18945,5,Range is good User interface is very good compared to other companies
18946,1,Low range WiFi networks 5 feet cover
18947,5,"Range is not good even having 4 antenna. Also number of lan port is less. Adaptor makes noise like flying house fly in home .. giving two star only for built quality, their no hanging Hooks are there on back side so only you can place it on table top."

18964,1,Not recommended stopper working in 2 months

19043,5,Very bad range
19044,4,"Overall the setting up of router is quite simple but if your broadband connection is giving 100mbps of speed through lan cable, than the router gives out only 50% of speed (i.e. 45 to 50mbps). Would expect xiaomi to look into this issue."
19045,5,Single band router good for home WiFi use. Range of 30 meter radius approx. No lagging and easy to configure. Thanks to Flipkart for timely delivery.

19322,5,"Decent product for routine internet home users. Handles load upto 3 users without a glitch. Wifi range good upto 10 meters without any objects/obstacles inbetween the router and the user. Range drops considerably when router is behind 1 or 2 walls and also affects the speed. But overall, it's a decent product for a 50mbps internet connection with 3-4 users if you position the router at the centre of your home. Easy to configure and budget friendly wireless router."

19794,1,"Good product. I am using as a repeater / extender. There 2 things I need to remember. 1. If you use different SSID name, then frequently ur internet is going to disconnect from the main modem. So you have to keep same name and same password for the router.  2. If I use both router at a time, then the internet speed is dropped to 60 - 70 % from the main router.  Overall it is a good product."

20009,5,Best product
20010,1,"Easy to install,good range ,getting speed upto 10mbps according to my net plan."
20011,5,As of now router is working fine but some time there is connectivity issue i guess it was due to local provider end.
20012,5,Easy to use
20013,5,There is a significant drop in the signal strength. A 30mbps connection gives only 5-8mbps throught this router but over 30mbps over Lan cable. The signal strength also drops after 5-8ft making it useless even for a 2bhk.

20054,5,Very poor product
20055,1,Good product
20056,5,Good wifi range
20057,1,It's Made In China. Otherwise it is great router with minimalist interface and range is good according to 2 antennas it will be worth it. You will face no loss till 5m after that it deteriorates and last you can get range upto 15-20 m radius that will be enough. Using it in the centre point of your house and you are good to go. Well I used it as a repeater it is extending main wifi's signal fully.  2.4GHz is the only mode for repeater too. Those who don't know Don't think that you will repeat...
20058,5,Ok working but signal not proper
20059,4,Super. Excellent wifi distribution. Very easy installation.
20060,4,Good one
20061,1,"After using almost 5 month I can say it one of the best router available .. It can penetrate 3 wall which is 5 inch , 10 inch , and 5 inch of thickness respectively with 40% signal strength .. and free space range is almost 50meter with 50% signal strength. If you place the router center of your house it can cover easily a 3bhk flat easily and can provide signal in 2 floor without any fluctuations.. In short just buy it..."
